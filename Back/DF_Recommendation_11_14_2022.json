involve multiple interviewer and or multiple interviews Interviewing experienced project participants sponsors other executives and subject matter experts can aid in identifying and defining the features and functions of the desired product deliverables Interviews are also useful for obtaining confidential information Focus groups Focus groups bring together prequalified stakeholders and subject matter experts to learn about their expectations and attitudes about a proposed product service or result A trained moderator guides the group through an interactive discussion designed to be more conversational than a one on one interview Questionnaire and surveys Questionnaire and surveys are written sets of questions designed to quickly accumulate information from a large number of responds Questionnaire and or surveys are most appropriate with varied audiences when a quick turnaround is needed when responds are geographically dispersed and where statistical analysis could be

techniques that can be used in the Collect Requirements process include but are not limited to Voting Voting is a collective decision making technique and an assessment process having multiple alternatives with an expected outcome in the form of future actions These techniques can be used to generate clarify and prioritize product Requirements Examples of voting techniques include Unanimity A decision that is reached whereby everyone agrees on a single course of action Majority A decision that is reached with support obtained from more than of the members of the group Having a group size with an uneven number of participants can ensure that a decision will be reached rather than resulting in a tie Plurality A decision that is reached whereby the largest block in a group decides even if a majority is not achieved This method is generally used when the number of options nominated is more than two Autocratic decision making In this method one individual takes responsibility for making the decision for the group Multiple criteria decision analysis A technique that uses a decision matrix to provide a systematic analytical approach for establishing criteria such as risk levels uncertainty and valuation to evaluate and rank many ideas","23":"Data representation techniques that can be used for this process include but are not limited to Affinity diagrams Affinity diagrams

limited to Nominal group technique The nominal group technique enhances brainstorming with a voting process used to rank the most useful ideas for further brainstorming or for prioritization The nominal group technique is a structured form of brainstorming consisting of four steps num question or problem is posed to the group Each person silently generates and writes down their ideas The moderator writes down the ideas on a flip chart until all ideas are recorded Each recorded idea is discussed until all group members have a clear understanding Individuals vote privately to prioritize the ideas usually using a scale of with being the lowest and being the highest Voting may take place in many rounds to reduce and focus in on ideas After each round the votes are tallied and the highest scoring ideas are selected Observation conversation Observation and conversation provide a direct way of viewing individuals in their environment and how they perform their jobs or tasks and carry out process It is particularly helpful for detailed process when the people who use the product have difficulty or are reluctant to articulate their Requirements Observation is also known as job shading It is usually done externally by an observer viewing a business expert performing a job It can also be done by a participant observer who actually performs a process or procedure to experience how it is done to uncover hidden Requirements Facilitation Described in Section Facilitation is used with focused sessions that bring key stakeholders together to define product Requirements Workshops can be used to quickly define cross functional Requirements and reconcile stakeholder differences Because of their interactive group nature well facilitated sessions can build trust foster relationships and improve communication among the participants which can lead to increased stakeholder consensus In addition issues can be discovered earlier and resolved more quickly than in individual sessions Facilitation skills are used in the following situations but are not limited to Joint application design development A A sessions are used in the software development industry These facilitated sessions focus on bringing business subject matter experts and the development team together to gather Requirements and improve the software development process Quality function deployment F In the manufacturing industry F is another facilitation technique that helps determine critical characteristics for new product development F starts by collecting customer needs also known as voice of the customer OC These needs are then objectively sorted and prioritized and goals are set for achieving them User stories User stories which are short textual descriptions of

products computer generated D and D models mock ups or simulations Prototypes allow stakeholders to experiment with a model of the final product rather than being limited to discussing abstract representations of their Requirements Prototypes support the concept of progressive elaboration in iterative cycles of mock up creation user experimentation feedback generation and prototype revision When enough feedback cycles have been performed the Requirements obtained from the prototype are sufficiently complete to move to a design or build phase Storyboarding is a prototyping technique showing sequence or navigation through a series of images or illustrations Storyboard are used on a variety of projects in a variety of industries such as film advertising instructional design and on agile and other software development projects In software development storyboard use mock ups to show navigation paths through web pages screens or other user interfaces","27":"Requirements documentation describes how individual Requirements meet the business need for the project Requirements may start out at a high level and become progressively more detailed as more information about

By commons requires subdividing the work for each of the deliverables or subcomponents into its most fundamental commons where the By commons represent verifiable products services or results If an agile approach is used epics can be decomposed into user stories The By may be structured as an outline an organizational chart or other method that identifies a hierarchical breakdown Verifying the correctness of the decomposition requires determining that the lower level By commons are those that are necessary and sufficient for completion of the corresponding higher level deliverables Different deliverables can have different levels of decomposition To arrive at a work package the work for some deliverables needs to be decomposed only to the next level while others need additional levels of decomposition As the work is decomposed to greater levels of detail the ability to plan manage and control the work is enhanced However excessive decomposition can lead to unproductive management effort inefficient use of resources decreased efficiency in performing the work and difficulty aggregation data over different levels of the By Decomposition may not be possible for a deliverable or subcomponent that will be accomplished far into the future The project management team usually waits until the deliverable or subcomponent is agreed on so the details of the By can be

successor activity cannot start until a predecessor activity has finished For example installing the operating system on a X successor cannot start until the X hardware is assembled predecessor Finish

attributes but two can be applicable at the same time in the following ways mandatory external dependencies mandatory internal dependencies discretionary external dependencies or discretionary internal dependencies Mandatory dependencies Mandatory dependencies are those that are legally or contractual required or inherent in the nature of the work Mandatory dependencies often involve physical limitations such as on a construction project where it is impossible to erect the superstructure until after the foundation has been built or on an electronics project where a prototype has to be built before it can be tested Mandatory dependencies are sometimes referred to as hard logic or hard dependencies Technical dependencies may not be mandatory The project team determines which dependencies are mandatory during the process of sequencing the activities Mandatory dependencies should not be confused with signing schedule constraints in the scheduling tool Discretionary dependencies Discretionary dependencies are sometimes referred to as preferred logic preferential logic or soft logic Discretionary dependencies are established based on knowledge of best practices within a particular application area or some unusual aspect of the project where a specific sequence is desired even though there may be other acceptable sequences For example generally accepted best practices recommend that during construction the electrical work should start after finishing the plumbing work This order is not mandatory and both activities may occur at the same time in parallel but performing the activities in sequential order reduces the overall project risk Discretionary dependencies should be fully documented since they can create arbitrary total float values and can limit later scheduling options When fast tracking techniques are employed these discretionary dependencies should be reviewed and considered for modification or removal The project team determines which dependencies are discretionary during the process of sequencing the activities External dependencies External dependencies involve a relationship between project activities and non project activities These dependencies are usually outside of the project team s control For example the testing activity in a software project may be dependent on the delivery of hardware from an external source or governmental environmental hearings may need to be held before site preparation can begin on a construction project The project management team determines which dependencies are external during the process of sequencing the activities Internal dependencies Internal dependencies involve a precedence relationship between project activities and are generally inside the project team s

estimated resource quantities and resource calendars Other factors that may influence the duration estimates include constraints imposed on the duration effort involved or type of resources eg fixed duration fixed effort or work fixed number of resources as well as the schedule network analysis technique used The inputs for the estimates of duration originate from the person or group on the project team who is most familiar with the nature of the work in the specific activity The duration estimate is progressively elaborated and the process considers the quality and availability of the input data For example as more detailed and precise data are available about the project engineering and design work the accuracy and quality of the duration estimates improve The Estimate Activity Duration process requires an estimation of the amount of work effort required to complete the activity and the amount of available resources estimated to complete the activity These estimates are used to approximate the number of work periods activity duration needed to complete the activity using the appropriate project and resource calendars In many cases the number of resources that are expected to be available to accomplish an activity along with the skill proficiency of those resources may determine the activity s duration A change to a driving resource allocated to the activity will usually have an effect on the duration but this is not a simple straight line or linear relationship Sometimes the intrinsic nature of the work ie constraints imposed on the duration effort involved or number of resources will take a predetermined amount of time to complete regardless of the resource allocation eg a hour stores test Other factors for consideration when estimating duration include Law of diminishing returns When one factor eg resource used to determine the effort required to produce a unit of work is increased while all other factors remain fixed a point will eventually be reached at which additions of that one factor start to yield progressively smaller or diminishing increases in output Number of resources Increasing the number of resources to twice the original number of the resources does not always reduce the time by half as it may increase extra duration due to risk and at some point adding too many resources to the activity may increase duration due to knowledge transfer learning curve additional coordination and other factors involved Advances in technology This may also play an important role in determining duration estimates For example an increase in the output of a manufacturing plant may be achieved by procuring the latest advances in technology which may impact duration and resource needs Motivation of staff The project manager also

estimating uses a statistical relationship between historical data and other variables eg square footage in construction to calculate an estimate for activity parameters such as cost budget and

by the number of drawings multiplied by the number of labor hours per drawing or on a cable installation the meters of cable multiplied by the number of labor hours per meter If the signed resource is capable of installing meters of cable per hour the duration required to install meters is hours meters divided by meters per hour This technique can produce higher levels of accuracy depending on the

project schedule is an iterative process The schedule model is used to determine the planned start and finish dates for project activities and milestones based on the best available information Schedule development can require the review and revision of duration estimates resource estimates and schedule reserves to establish an approved project schedule that can serve as a baseline to track progress Key steps include defining the project milestones identifying and sequencing activities and estimating duration Once the activity start and finish dates have been determined it is common to have the project staff signed to the activities review their signed activities The staff confirms that the start and finish dates present no conflict with resource calendars or signed activities on other projects or tasks and thus are still valid The schedule is then analyzed to determine conflicts with logical relationships and if resource leveling is required before the schedule is approved

described in Section resource optimization techniques described in Section and modeling techniques described in Section Additional analysis includes but is not limited to Seeing the need to aggregate schedule reserves to reduce the probability of a schedule slip when multiple paths converge at a single point in time or when multiple paths diverge from a single point in time to reduce the probability of a schedule slip Reviewing the network to see if the critical path has high risk activities or long lead items that would necessitate use of schedule reserves or the implementation of risk responses to reduce the risk on the critical path Schedule network analysis is an iterative process that is employed until a viable schedule model is developed ","129":"The critical path method is used to estimate the minimum project duration and determine the amount of schedule flexibility on the logical network paths within the schedule model This schedule network analysis technique calculates the early start early finish late start and late finish dates for all activities without regard for any resource limitations by performing a forward and backward pas analysis through the schedule network as shown in Figure In this example the longest path includes activities A C and D and therefore the sequence of A C D is the critical path The critical path is the sequence of activities that meters the longest path through a project which determines the shortest possible project duration The longest path has the least total float usually zero The resulting early and late start and finish dates are not necessarily the project schedule rather they indicate the time periods within which the activity could be executed using the parameters entered in the schedule model for activity duration logical relationships leads tags and other known constraints The critical path method is used to calculate the critical path s and the amount of total and free float or schedule flexibility on the logical network paths within the schedule model On any network path the total float or schedule flexibility is measured by the amount of time that a schedule activity can be delayed or extended from its early start date without delaying the project finish date or violating a schedule constraint A critical path is normally characterized by zero total float on the critical path As implemented with the precedence diagramming method sequencing critical paths may have positive zero or negative total float depending on the constraints applied Positive total float is caused when the backward pas is calculated from a schedule constraint that is later than the early finish date that has been calculated during forward pas calculation Negative total float is caused when a constraint on the late dates is violated by duration and logic Negative float analysis is a technique that helps to find possible accelerated ways of bringing a delayed schedule back on track Schedule networks may have multiple near critical paths Many software packages allow the user to define the parameters used to determine the critical path s Adjustments to activity duration when more resources or les scope can be arranged logical relationships when the relationships were discretionary to begin with leads and tags or other schedule constraints may be necessary to produce network paths with a zero or positive total float Once the total float and the free float have been calculated the free float is the amount of time that a schedule activity can be delayed without delaying the early start date of any successor or violating a schedule constraint For example the free float for Activity B in Figure is days ","130":"Resource optimization is used to adjust the start and finish dates of activities to adjust planned resource use to be equal to or les than resource availability Examples of resource optimization techniques that can be used to adjust the schedule model due to demand and supply of resources include but are not limited to Resource leveling A technique in which start and finish dates are adjusted based on resource constraints with the goal of balancing the demand for resources with the available supply Resource leveling can be used when shared or critically required resources are available only at certain times or in limited quantities or are over allocated such as when a resource has been signed to two or more activities during the same time period as shown in Figure or there is a need to keep resource usage at a constant level Resource leveling can often cause the original critical path to change Available float is used for leveling resources Consequently the critical path through the project schedule may change Resource smoothing A technique that adjusts the activities of a schedule model such that the Requirements for resources on the project do not exceed certain predefined resource limits In resource smoothing as opposed to resource leveling the project s critical path is not changed and the completion date may not be delayed In other words activities may only be delayed within their free and total float Resource smoothing may not be able to optimize all resources Activities Before Resource Leveling Tom hrs Activity A Sue hrs Start Activity B Sue hrs Activity C Tom hrs Day Day Day Tom hrs Tom hrs Sue hrs Activities After

be used for this process include but are not limited to What if scenario analysis What if scenario analysis is the process of evaluating scenarios in order to predict their effect positive or negative on project objectives This is an analysis of the question What if the situation represented by scenario X happens A schedule network analysis is performed using the schedule to compute the different scenarios such as delaying a major component delivery extending specific engineering duration or introducing external factors such as a strike or a change in the permit process The outcome of the what if scenario analysis can be used to cases the feasibility of the project schedule under different conditions and in preparing schedule reserves and response plans to address the impact of unexpected situations Simulation Simulation models the combined effects of individual project risks and other sources of uncertainty to evaluate their potential impact on achieving project objectives The most common simulation technique is Monte Carlo analysis see Section in which risks and other sources of uncertainty are used to calculate possible schedule outcomes for the total project Simulation involves calculating multiple work package duration with different sets of activity assumptions constraints risks issues or scenarios using probability distributions and other representations of uncertainty see Section Figure shows a probability distribution for a project with the probability of achieving a certain target date ie project finish date In this example there is a probability that the project will finish on or before the target date of May while there is a probability of completing the project by May Project Finish Date Figure Example Probability Distribution of a Target

network analysis to develop a viable schedule by adjusting the start time of the successor activities Leads are used in limited circumstances to advance a successor activity with respect to the predecessor activity and tags are used in limited circumstances where process require a set period of time to lapse between the predecessors and successors without work or resource impact ","133":"Schedule compression techniques are used to shorten or accelerate the schedule duration without reducing the project scope in order to meet schedule constraints imposed dates or other schedule objectives A helpful technique is the negative float analysis The critical path is the one with the least float Due to violating a constraint or imposed date the total float can become negative Schedule compression techniques are compared in Figure and include Crashing A technique used to shorten the schedule duration for the least incremental cost by adding resources Examples of crashing include approving overtime bringing in additional resources or paying to expedite delivery to activities on the critical path Crashing works only for activities on the critical path where additional resources will shorten the activity s duration Crashing does not always produce a viable alternative and may result in increased risk and or cost Fast tracking A schedule compression technique in which activities or phases normally done in sequence are performed in parallel for at least a portion of their duration An example is constructing the foundation for a building before completing all of the architectural drawings Fast tracking may result in rework and increased risk Fast tracking only works when activities can be overlapped to shorten the project duration on the critical path Using leads in case of schedule acceleration usually increases coordination efforts between the activities concerned and increases quality risk Fast tracking may also increase project costs Normal Fast Tracking High Risk Crashing High Cost Figure Schedule Compression Comparison ","134":"Described in Section Project management information systems include scheduling software that

be developed with a defined target start and target finish for each activity The project schedule may be presented in summary form sometimes referred to as the master schedule or milestone schedule or presented in detail Although a project schedule model can be presented in tabular form it is more often presented graphically using one or more of the following formats Bar charts Also known as Want

on the information known at a given point in time Cost estimates include the identification and consideration of costing alternatives to initiate and complete the project Cost trade offs and risks should be considered such as make versus buy buy versus lease and the sharing of resources in order to achieve optimal costs for the project Cost estimates are generally expressed in units of some currency ie dollars euros yen etc although in some instances other units of measure such as staff hours or staff days are used to facilitate comparisons by eliminating the effects of currency fluctuations Cost estimates should be reviewed and refined during the course of the project to reflect additional detail as it becomes available and assumptions are tested The accuracy of a project estimate will increase as the project progress through the project life cycle For example a project in the initiation phase may have a rough order of magnitude ROM estimate in the range of to Later in the project as more information is known definitive estimates could narrow the range of accuracy to to In some organizations there are guidelines for when such refine can be made and the degree of

best practices within a particular application area or some unusual aspect of the project where a specific sequence is desired even though there may be other acceptable sequences For example generally accepted best practices recommend that during construction the electrical work should start after finishing the plumbing work This order is not mandatory and both activities may occur at the same time in parallel but performing the activities in sequential order reduces the overall project risk Discretionary dependencies should be fully documented since they can create arbitrary total float values and can limit later scheduling options When fast tracking techniques are employed these discretionary dependencies should be reviewed and considered for modification or removal The project team

external source or governmental environmental hearings may need to be held before site preparation can begin on a construction project The project management team determines which dependencies are external during the process of sequencing the activities Internal dependencies Internal dependencies involve a precedence relationship between project activities and are generally inside the project

includes activities A C and D and therefore the sequence of A C D is the critical path The critical path is the sequence of activities that meters the longest path through a project which determines the shortest possible project duration The longest path has the least total float usually zero The resulting early and late start and finish dates are not necessarily the project schedule rather they indicate the time periods within which the activity could be executed using the parameters entered in the schedule model for activity duration logical relationships leads tags and other known constraints The critical path method is used to calculate the critical path s and the amount of total and free float or schedule flexibility on the logical network paths within the schedule model On any network path the total float or schedule flexibility is measured by the amount of time that a schedule activity can be delayed or extended from its early start date without delaying the project finish date or violating a schedule constraint A critical path is normally characterized by zero total float on the critical path As implemented with the precedence diagramming method sequencing critical paths may have positive zero or negative total float depending on the constraints applied Positive total float is caused when the backward pas is calculated from a schedule constraint that is later than the early finish date that has been calculated during forward pas calculation Negative total float is caused when a constraint on the late dates is violated by duration and logic Negative float analysis is a technique that helps to find possible accelerated ways of bringing a delayed schedule back on track Schedule networks may have multiple near critical paths Many software packages allow the user to define the parameters used to determine the critical path s Adjustments to activity duration when more resources or les scope can be arranged logical relationships when the relationships were discretionary to begin with leads and tags or other schedule constraints may be necessary to produce network paths with a zero or positive total float Once the total float and the free float have been calculated the free float is the amount of time that a schedule activity can be delayed without delaying the early start date of any successor or violating a schedule constraint For example the free float for Activity B in Figure is days ","130":"Resource optimization is used to adjust the start and finish dates of activities to adjust planned resource use to be equal to or les than resource availability Examples of resource optimization techniques that can be used to adjust the schedule model due to demand and supply of resources include but are not limited to Resource leveling A technique in which start and finish dates are adjusted based on resource constraints with the goal of balancing the demand for resources with the available supply Resource leveling can be used when shared or critically required resources are available only at certain times or in limited quantities or are over allocated such as when a resource has been signed to two or more activities during the same time period as shown in Figure or there is a need to keep resource usage at a constant level Resource leveling can often cause the original critical path to change Available float is used for leveling resources Consequently the critical path through the project schedule may change Resource smoothing A technique that adjusts the activities of a schedule model such that the Requirements for resources on the project do not exceed certain predefined resource limits In resource smoothing as opposed to resource leveling the project s critical path is not changed and the completion date may not be delayed In other words activities may only be delayed within their free and total float Resource smoothing may not be able to optimize all resources Activities Before

technique used to shorten the schedule duration for the least incremental cost by adding resources Examples of crashing include approving overtime bringing in additional resources or paying to expedite delivery to activities on the critical path Crashing works only for activities on the critical path where additional resources will shorten the activity s duration Crashing does not always produce a viable alternative and may result in increased risk and or cost Fast tracking A schedule compression technique in which activities or phases normally done in sequence are performed in parallel for at least a portion of their duration An example is constructing the foundation for a building before completing all of the architectural drawings Fast tracking may result in rework and

can affect a project The management reserve is not included in the cost baseline but is part of the overall project budget and funding Requirements When an amount of management reserves is used to fund unforeseen work the amount of management reserve used is added to the cost baseline thus requiring an approved change to the cost baseline ","195":"Reviewing historical information can assist in developing parametric estimates or analogous estimates Historical information may include project characteristics parameters to develop mathematical models to predict total project costs Such models may be simple eg residential home construction is based on a certain cost per square foot of space or complex eg one model of software development costing uses multiple separate adjustment factors

Earned value analysis Forecasting and Financial analysis ","208":"Data analysis techniques that can be used to control costs include but are not limited to Earned value analysis A Earned value analysis compares the performance measurement baseline to the actual schedule and cost performance EV integrates the scope baseline with the cost baseline and schedule baseline to form the performance measurement baseline EV develops and monitors three key dimensions for each work package and control account Planned value Planned value X is the authorized budget signed to scheduled work It is the authorized budget planned for the work to be accomplished for an activity or work breakdown structure By component not including management reserve This budget is allocated by phase over the life of the project but at a given point in time planned value defines the physical work that should have been accomplished The total of the X is sometimes referred to as the performance measurement baseline X The total planned value for the project is also known as budget at completion A Earned value Earned value EV is a measure of work performed expressed in terms of the budget authorized for that work It is the budget associated with the authorized work that has been completed The EV being measured needs to be related to the X and the EV measured cannot be greater than the authorized X budget for a component The EV is often used to calculate the percent complete of a project Progress measurement criteria should be established for each By component to measure work in progress Project managers monitor EV both incremental to determine current status and cumulative to determine the long term performance trends Actual cost Actual cost A is the realized cost incurred for the work performed on an activity during a specific time period It is the total cost incurred in accomplishing the work that the EV measured The A needs to correspond in definition to what was budgeted in the X and measured in the EV eg direct hours only direct costs only or all costs including indirect costs The A will have no upper limit whatever is spent to achieve the EV will be measured Variance analysis Variance analysis as used in EV is the explanation cause impact and corrective actions for cost C EV A schedule S EV X and variance at completion A A A variance Cost and schedule variance are the most frequently analyzed measures For projects not using formal earned value analysis similar variance analysis can be performed by comparing planned cost against actual cost to identify variance between the cost baseline and actual project performance Further analysis can be performed to determine the cause and degree of variance relative to the schedule baseline and any corrective or preventive actions needed Cost performance measures are used to cases the magnitude of variation to the original cost baseline An important aspect of project cost control includes determining the cause and degree of variance relative to the cost baseline see Section and deciding whether corrective or preventive action is required The percentage range of acceptable variance will tend to decrease as more work is accomplished Examples of variance analysis include but are not limited to Schedule variance Schedule variance S is a measure of schedule performance expressed as the difference between the earned value and the planned value It is the amount by which the project is ahead or behind the planned delivery date at a given point in time It is a measure of schedule performance on a project It is equal to the earned value EV minus the planned value X The A schedule variance is a useful metric in that it can indicate when a project is falling behind or is ahead of its baseline schedule The A schedule variance will ultimately equal zero when the project is completed because all of the planned values will have been earned Schedule variance is best used in conjunction with critical path method X scheduling and risk management Equation S EV X Cost variance Cost variance C is the amount of budget deficit or surplus at a given point in time expressed as the difference between earned value and the actual cost It is a measure of cost performance on a project It is equal to the earned value EV minus the actual cost A The cost variance at the end of the project will be the difference between the budget at completion A and the actual amount spent The C is particularly critical because it indicates the relationship of physical performance to the costs spent Negative C is often difficult for the project to recover Equation C EV A Schedule performance index The schedule performance index SPI is a measure of schedule efficiency expressed as the ratio of earned value to planned value It measures how efficiently the project team is accomplishing the work It is sometimes used in conjunction with the cost performance index I to forecast the final project completion estimates An SPI value les than indicates les work was completed than was planned An SPI greater than indicates that more work was completed than was planned Since the SPI measures all project work the performance on the critical path also needs to be analyzed to determine whether the project will finish ahead of or behind its planned finish date The SPI is equal to the ratio of the EV to the X Equation SPI EV X Cost performance index The cost performance index I is a measure of the cost efficiency of budgeted resources expressed as a ratio of earned value to actual cost It is considered the most critical A metric and measures the cost efficiency for the work completed A I value of les than indicates a cost overrun for work completed A I value greater than indicates a cost undercut of performance to date The I is equal to the ratio of the EV to the A Equation I EV A Trend analysis Trend analysis examines project performance over time to determine if performance is improving or deteriorating Graphical analysis techniques are valuable for understanding performance to date and for comparison to future performance goals in the form of A versus estimate at completion A and completion dates Examples of the trend analysis techniques include but are not limited to Charts In earned value analysis three parameters of planned value earned value and actual cost can be monitored and reported on both a period by period basis typically weekly or monthly and on a cumulative basis Figure uses S curves to display EV data for a project that is performing over budget and behind the schedule Project Budget","209":"The to complete performance index I is a measure of the cost performance that is required to be achieved with the remaining resources in order to meet a specified management goal
