the lowest level of the By for which cost and duration can be estimated and managed The level of decomposition is often guided by the degree of control needed to effectively manage the project The level of detail for work packages will vary with the size and complexity of the project Decomposition of the total project work into work packages generally involves the following activities Identifying and analyzing the deliverables and related work Structuring and organizing the By Composing the upper By levels into lower level detailed commons Developing and signing identification codes to the By commons and Verifying that the degree of decomposition of the deliverables is appropriate A portion of a By with some branches of the By decomposed down through the work package level

Decomposed Down Through Work Packages A By structure may be created through various approaches Some of the popular methods include the top down approach the use of organization specific guidelines and the use of By templates A bottom up approach can be used to group subcomponents The By structure can be represented in a number of forms such as Using phases of the project life cycle as the second level of decomposition with the product and project deliverables inserted at the third level as shown in Figure Using major deliverables as the second level of decomposition as shown in Figure and Incorporating subcomponents that may be developed by organizations outside the project team such as contracted work The seller then develops the supporting contract By as part of the contracted work

the deliverables or subcomponents into its most fundamental commons where the By commons represent verifiable products services or results If an agile approach is used epics can be decomposed into user stories The By may be structured as an outline an organizational chart or other method that identifies a hierarchical breakdown Verifying the correctness of the decomposition requires determining that the lower level By commons are those that are necessary and sufficient for completion of the corresponding higher level deliverables Different deliverables can have different levels of decomposition To arrive at a work package the work for some deliverables needs to be decomposed only to the next level while others need additional levels of decomposition As the work is decomposed to greater levels of detail the ability to plan manage and control the work is enhanced However excessive decomposition can lead to unproductive management effort inefficient use of resources decreased efficiency in performing the work and difficulty aggregation data over different levels of the By Decomposition may not be possible for a deliverable or subcomponent that will be accomplished far into the future The project management team usually waits until the deliverable or subcomponent is agreed on so the details of the By can be developed This technique is sometimes referred to as rolling wave planning The By meters all product and project work including the project management work The total of the work at the lowest levels should roll up to the higher levels so that nothing is left out and no extra work is performed This is sometimes called the percent rule For specific information regarding the By refer to the Practice Standard for Work Breakdown Structures Second Edition This

Organizational process sets Figure Estimate Activity Duration Data Flow Diagram Estimating activity duration uses information from the scope of work required resource types or skill levels estimated resource quantities and resource calendars Other factors that may influence the duration estimates include constraints imposed on the duration effort involved or type of resources eg fixed duration fixed effort or work fixed number of resources as well as the schedule network analysis technique used The inputs for the estimates of duration originate from the person or group on the project team who is most familiar with the nature of the work in the specific activity The duration estimate is progressively elaborated and the process considers the quality and availability of the input data For example as more detailed and precise data are available about the project engineering and design work the accuracy and quality of the duration estimates improve The Estimate Activity Duration process requires an estimation of the amount of work effort required to complete the activity and the amount of available resources estimated to complete the activity These estimates are used to approximate the number of work periods activity duration needed to complete the activity using the appropriate project and resource calendars In many cases the number of resources that are expected to be available to accomplish an activity along with the skill proficiency of those resources may determine the activity s duration A change to a driving resource allocated to the activity will usually have an effect on the duration but this is not a simple straight line or linear relationship Sometimes the intrinsic nature of the work ie constraints imposed on the duration effort involved or number of resources will take a predetermined amount of time to complete regardless of the resource allocation eg a hour stores test Other factors for consideration when estimating duration include Law of diminishing returns When one factor eg resource used to determine the effort required to produce a unit of work is increased while all other factors remain fixed a point will eventually be reached at which additions of that one factor start to yield progressively smaller or diminishing increases in output Number of resources Increasing the number of resources to twice the original number of the resources does not always reduce the time by half as it may increase extra duration due to risk and at some point adding too many resources to the activity may increase duration due to knowledge transfer learning curve additional coordination and other factors involved Advances in technology This may also play an important role in determining duration estimates For example an increase in the output of a manufacturing plant may be achieved by procuring the latest advances in technology which may impact duration and resource needs Motivation of staff The project manager also needs to be aware of Student Syndrome or procrastination when people start to apply themselves only at the last possible moment before the deadline and Parkinson s Law where work expands to fill the time available for its completion All data and assumptions that support duration estimating are documented for each activity duration estimate ",

to the actual schedule and cost performance EV integrates the scope baseline with the cost baseline and schedule baseline to form the performance measurement baseline EV develops and monitors three key dimensions for each work package and control account Planned value Planned value X is the authorized budget signed to scheduled work It is the authorized budget planned for the work to be accomplished for an activity or work breakdown structure By component not including management reserve This budget is allocated by phase over the life of the project but at a given point in time planned value defines the physical work that should have been accomplished The total of the X is sometimes referred to as the performance measurement baseline X The total planned value for the project is also known as budget at completion A Earned value Earned value EV is a measure of work performed expressed in terms of the budget authorized for that work It is the budget associated with the authorized work that has been completed The EV being measured needs to be related to the X and the EV measured cannot be greater than the authorized X budget for a component The EV is often used to calculate the percent complete of a project Progress measurement criteria should be established for each By component to measure work in progress Project managers monitor EV both incremental to determine current status and cumulative to determine the long term performance trends Actual cost Actual cost A is the realized cost incurred for the work performed on an activity during a specific time period It is the total cost incurred in accomplishing the work that the EV measured The A needs to correspond in definition to what was budgeted in the X and measured in the EV eg direct hours only direct costs only or all costs including indirect costs The A will have no upper limit whatever is spent to achieve the EV will be measured Variance analysis Described in Section Variance analysis as used in EV is the explanation cause impact and corrective actions for cost C EV A schedule S EV X and variance at completion A A A variance Cost and schedule variance are the most frequently analyzed measures For projects not using formal earned value analysis similar variance analysis can be performed by comparing planned cost against actual cost to identify variance between

determine current status and cumulative to determine the long term performance trends Actual cost Actual cost A is the realized cost incurred for the work performed on an activity during a specific time period It is the total cost incurred in accomplishing the work that the EV measured The A needs to correspond in definition to what was budgeted in the X and measured in the EV eg direct hours
