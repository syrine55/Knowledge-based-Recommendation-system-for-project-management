              "' Project Scope Management includes the processes required to ensure that the project includes all the work required,  and only the work required, to complete the project successfully. Managing the project scope is primarily concerned with  deﬁning and controlling what is and is not included in the project. The Project Scope Management processes are: 5.1 Plan Scope Management—The process of creating a scope management plan that documents how the project  and product scope will be deﬁned, validated, and controlled. 5.2 Collect Requirements—The process of determining, documenting, and managing stakeholder needs and  requirements to meet project objectives. 5.3 Define Scope—The process of developing a detailed description of the project and product. 5.4 Create WBS—The process of subdividing project deliverables and project work into smaller, more manageable  components. 5.5 Validate Scope—The process of formalizing acceptance of the completed project deliverables. 5.6 Control Scope—The process of monitoring the status of the project and product scope and managing changes  to the scope baseline. Figure 5-1 provides an overview of the Project Scope Management processes. The Project Scope Management  processes are presented as discrete processes with deﬁned interfaces while, in practice, they overlap and interact in  ways that cannot be completely detailed in the PMBOK® .

Project Scope Management Overview      , Plan Scope Management is the process of creating a scope management plan that documents how the project and  product scope will be deﬁned, validated, and controlled. The key beneﬁt of this process is that it provides guidance and  direction on how scope will be managed throughout the project. This process is performed once or at predeﬁned points  in the project. The inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of this process are depicted in Figure 5-2. Figure 5-3 depicts  the data ﬂow diagram of the process.

Plan Scope Management: Data Flow Diagram       The scope management plan is a component of the project or program management plan that describes how the  scope will be deﬁned, developed, monitored, controlled, and validated. The development of the scope management plan  and the detailing of the project scope begin with the analysis of information contained in the project charter (Section  4.1.3.1), the latest approved subsidiary plans of the project management plan (Section 4.2.3.1), historical information  contained in the organizational process assets (Section 2.3), and any other relevant enterprise environmental factors  (Section 2.2)., Described in Section 4.1.3.1. The project charter documents the project purpose, high-level project description,  assumptions, constraints, and high-level requirements that the project is intended to satisfy., Described in Section 4.2.3.1. Project management plan components include but are not limited to: Quality management plan. Described in Section 8.1.3.1. The way the project and product scope will be   managed can be inﬂuenced by how the organization’s quality policy, methodologies, and standards are  implemented on the project. Project life cycle description. The project life cycle determines the series of phases that a project passes  through from its inception to the end of the project.  Development approach. The development approach deﬁnes whether waterfall, iterative, adaptive, agile, or a  hybrid development approach will be used., The enterprise environmental factors that can inﬂuence the Plan Scope Management process include but are not   limited to:  Organization’s culture, Infrastructure, Personnel administration, and Marketplace conditions. , The organizational process assets that can inﬂuence the Plan Scope Management process include but are not  limited to: Policies and procedures, and Historical information and lessons learned repositories., Described in Section 4.1.2.1 Expertise should be considered from individuals or groups with specialized knowledge  or training in the following topics: Previous similar projects, and Information in the industry, discipline, and application area., A data analysis technique that can be used for this process includes but is not limited to alternatives analysis.  Various ways of collecting requirements, elaborating the project and product scope, creating the product, validating  the scope, and controlling the scope are evaluated., Project teams may attend project meetings to develop the scope management plan. Attendees may include the  project manager, the project sponsor, selected project team members, selected stakeholders, anyone with responsibility  for any of the scope management processes, and others as needed.      , The scope management plan is a component of the project management plan that describes how the scope will be  deﬁned, developed, monitored, controlled, and validated. The components of a scope management plan include: Process for preparing a project scope statement; Process that enables the creation of the WBS from the detailed project scope statement; Process that establishes how the scope baseline will be approved and maintained; and Process that speciﬁes how formal acceptance of the completed project deliverables will be obtained. The scope management plan can be formal or informal, broadly framed or highly detailed, based on the needs  of the project., The requirements management plan is a component of the project management plan that describes how project and  product requirements will be analyzed, documented, and managed. According to Business Analysis for Practitioners:  A Practice  [7], some organizations refer to it as a business analysis plan. Components of the requirements  management plan can include but are not limited to: How requirements activities will be planned, tracked, and reported; Conﬁguration management activities such as: how changes will be initiated; how impacts will be analyzed; how  they will be traced, tracked, and reported; as well as the authorization levels required to approve these changes; Requirements prioritization process; Metrics that will be used and the rationale for using them; and Traceability structure that reﬂects the requirement attributes captured on the traceability matrix.   , Collect Requirements is the process of determining, documenting, and managing stakeholder needs and requirements  to meet objectives. The key beneﬁt of this process is that it provides the basis for deﬁning the product scope and project  scope. This process is performed once or at predeﬁned points in the project. The inputs, tools and techniques, and  outputs of this process are depicted in Figure 5-4. Figure 5-5 depicts the data ﬂow diagram of the process.

Collect Requirements: Data Flow Diagram  The PMBOK®  does not speciﬁcally address product requirements since those are industry speciﬁc. Note that  Business Analysis for Practitioners: A Practice  [7] provides more in-depth information about product requirements.  The project’s success is directly inﬂuenced by active stakeholder involvement in the discovery and decomposition of  needs into project and product requirements and by the care taken in determining, documenting, and managing the  requirements of the product, service, or result of the project. Requirements include conditions or capabilities that are  required to be present in a product, service, or result to satisfy an agreement or other formally imposed speciﬁcation.  Requirements include the quantiﬁed and documented needs and expectations of the sponsor, customer, and other  stakeholders. These requirements need to be elicited, analyzed, and recorded in enough detail to be included in the  scope baseline and to be measured once project execution begins. Requirements become the foundation of the WBS.  Cost, schedule, quality planning, and procurement are all based on these requirements., Described in Section 4.1.3.1. The project charter documents the high-level project description and high-level  requirements that will be used to develop detailed requirements., Described in Section 4.2.3.1. Project management plan components include but are not limited to: Scope management plan. Described in Section 5.1.3.1. The scope management plan contains information on  how the project scope will be deﬁned and developed. Requirements management plan. Described in Section 5.1.3.2. The requirements management plan has  information on how project requirements will be collected, analyzed, and documented. Stakeholder engagement plan. Described in Section 13.2.3.1. The stakeholder engagement plan is used  to understand stakeholder communication requirements and the level of stakeholder engagement in order to  assess and adapt to the level of stakeholder participation in requirements activities.      , Examples of project documents that can be considered as inputs for this process include but are not limited to: Assumption Log. Described in Section 4.1.3.2. The assumption log identiﬁed assumptions about the product,  project, environment, stakeholders, and other factors that can inﬂuence requirements. Lessons learned register. Described in Section 4.4.3.1. The lessons learned register is used to provide  information on effective requirements collection techniques, especially for projects that are using an iterative or  adaptive product development methodology. Stakeholder Register. Described in Section 13.1.3.1. The stakeholder register is used to identify stakeholders  who can provide information on the requirements. It also captures requirements and expectations that  stakeholders have for the project., Described in Section 1.2.6. A business document that can inﬂuence the Collect Requirements process is the  business case, which can describe required, desired, and optional criteria for meeting the business needs., Described in Section 12.2.3.2. Agreements can contain project and product requirements., The enterprise environmental factors that can inﬂuence the Collect Requirements process include but are not limited to: Organization’s culture, Infrastructure, Personnel administration, and Marketplace conditions.  , The organizational process assets that can inﬂuence the Collect Requirements process include but are not limited to: Policies and procedures, and Historical information and lessons learned repository with information from previous projects. , Described in Section 4.1.2.1. Expertise should be considered from individuals or groups with specialized knowledge  or training in the following topics: Business analysis, Requirements elicitation, Requirements analysis, Requirements documentation, Project requirements in previous similar projects, Diagramming techniques, Facilitation, and Conﬂict management., Data-gathering techniques that can be used for this process include but are not limited to: Brainstorming. Described in Section 4.1.2.2. Brainstorming is a technique used to generate and collect multiple  ideas related to project and product requirements. Interviews. An interview is a formal or informal approach to elicit information from stakeholders by talking  to them directly. It is typically performed by asking prepared and spontaneous questions and recording the  responses. Interviews are often conducted on an individual basis between an interviewer and an interviewee, but  may involve multiple interviewers and/or multiple interviewees. Interviewing experienced project participants,  sponsors, other executives, and subject matter experts can aid in identifying and deﬁning the features and  functions of the desired product deliverables. Interviews are also useful for obtaining conﬁdential information. Focus groups. Focus groups bring together prequaliﬁed stakeholders and subject matter experts to learn about  their expectations and attitudes about a proposed product, service, or result. A trained moderator guides the  group through an interactive discussion designed to be more conversational than a one-on-one interview.       Questionnaires and surveys. Questionnaires and surveys are written sets of questions designed to quickly  accumulate information from a large number of respondents. Questionnaires and/or surveys are most appropriate  with varied audiences, when a quick turnaround is needed, when respondents are geographically dispersed, and  where statistical analysis could be appropriate. Benchmarking. Described in Section 8.1.2.2. Benchmarking involves comparing actual or planned products,  processes, and practices to those of comparable organizations to identify best practices, generate ideas for  improvement, and provide a basis for measuring performance. The organizations compared during benchmarking  can be internal or external., Described in Section 4.5.2.2. Data analysis techniques that can be used for this process include but are not limited  to document analysis. Document analysis consists of reviewing and assessing any relevant documented information.  In this process, document analysis is used to elicit requirements by analyzing existing documentation and identifying  information relevant to the requirements. There is a wide range of documents that may be analyzed to help elicit relevant  requirements. Examples of documents that may be analyzed include but are not limited to: Agreements; Business plans; Business process or interface documentation; Business rules repositories; Current process ﬂows; Marketing literature; Problem/issue logs; Policies and procedures; Regulatory documentation such as laws, codes, or ordinances, etc.; Requests for proposal; and Use cases. , Decision-making techniques that can be used in the Collect Requirements process include but are not limited to: Voting. Voting is a collective decision-making technique and an assessment process having multiple alternatives  with an expected outcome in the form of future actions. These techniques can be used to generate, classify, and  prioritize product requirements. Examples of voting techniques include: nuUnanimity. A decision that is reached whereby everyone agrees on a single course of action. nuMajority. A decision that is reached with support obtained from more than 50% of the members of the group.  Having a group size with an uneven number of participants can ensure that a decision will be reached, rather  than resulting in a tie. nuPlurality. A decision that is reached whereby the largest block in a group decides, even if a majority is not  achieved. This method is generally used when the number of options nominated is more than two.  Autocratic decision making. In this method, one individual takes responsibility for making the decision  for the group. Multicriteria decision analysis. A technique that uses a decision matrix to provide a systematic analytical  approach for establishing criteria, such as risk levels, uncertainty, and valuation, to evaluate and rank many ideas., Data representation techniques that can be used for this process include but are not limited to: Affinity diagrams. Afﬁnity diagrams allow large numbers of ideas to be classiﬁed into groups for review and  analysis. Mind mapping. Mind mapping consolidates ideas created through individual brainstorming sessions into a  single map to reﬂect commonality and differences in understanding and to generate new ideas., Described in Section 4.1.2.3. The interpersonal and team skills that can be used in this process include but are not  limited to: Nominal group technique. The nominal group technique enhances brainstorming with a voting process used  to rank the most useful ideas for further brainstorming or for prioritization. The nominal group technique is a  structured form of brainstorming consisting of four steps:       nuA question or problem is posed to the group. Each person silently generates and writes down their ideas. nuThe moderator writes down the ideas on a ﬂip chart until all ideas are recorded. nuEach recorded idea is discussed until all group members have a clear understanding. nuIndividuals vote privately to prioritize the ideas, usually using a scale of 1 – 5, with 1 being the lowest and 5  being the highest. Voting may take place in many rounds to reduce and focus in on ideas. After each round,  the votes are tallied and the highest scoring ideas are selected. Observation/conversation. Observation and conversation provide a direct way of viewing individuals in their  environment and how they perform their jobs or tasks and carry out processes. It is particularly helpful for detailed  processes when the people who use the product have difﬁculty or are reluctant to articulate their requirements.  Observation is also known as “job shadowing.” It is usually done externally by an observer viewing a business  expert performing a job. It can also be done by a “participant observer” who actually performs a process or  procedure to experience how it is done to uncover hidden requirements. Facilitation. Described in Section 4.1.2.3. Facilitation is used with focused sessions that bring key stakeholders  together  to  deﬁne  product  requirements.  Workshops  can  be  used  to  quickly  deﬁne  cross-functional  requirements and reconcile stakeholder differences. Because of their interactive group nature, well-facilitated  sessions can build trust, foster relationships, and improve communication among the participants, which can  lead to increased stakeholder consensus. In addition, issues can be discovered earlier and resolved more  quickly than in individual sessions. Facilitation skills are used in the following situations, but are not limited to: nuJoint application design/development (JAD). JAD sessions are used in the software development industry.  These facilitated sessions focus on bringing business subject matter experts and the development team  together to gather requirements and improve the software development process. nuQuality function deployment (QFD). In the manufacturing industry, QFD is another facilitation technique that  helps determine critical characteristics for new product development. QFD starts by collecting customer  needs, also known as voice of the customer (VOC). These needs are then objectively sorted and prioritized,  and goals are set for achieving them. nuUser stories. User stories, which are short, textual descriptions of required functionality, are often developed  during a requirements workshop. User stories describe the stakeholder role, who beneﬁts from the feature  (role), what the stakeholder needs to accomplish (goal), and the beneﬁt to the stakeholder (motivation). , The context diagram is an example of a scope model. Context diagrams visually depict the product scope by showing  a business system (process, equipment, computer system, etc.), and how people and other systems (actors) interact  with it (see Figure 5-6). Context diagrams show inputs to the business system, the actor(s) providing the input, the  outputs from the business system, and the actor(s) receiving the output.

Examples of prototypes are small-scale products, computer generated 2D and 3D models,  mock-ups, or simulations. Prototypes allow stakeholders to experiment with a model of the ﬁnal product rather than  being limited to discussing abstract representations of their requirements. Prototypes support the concept of progressive  elaboration in iterative cycles of mock-up creation, user experimentation, feedback generation, and prototype revision.  When enough feedback cycles have been performed, the requirements obtained from the prototype are sufﬁciently  complete to move to a design or build phase. Storyboarding is a prototyping technique showing sequence or navigation through a series of images or illustrations.  Storyboards are used on a variety of projects in a variety of industries, such as ﬁlm, advertising, instructional design,  and on agile and other software development projects. In software development, storyboards use mock-ups to show  navigation paths through web pages, screens, or other user interfaces., Requirements documentation describes how individual requirements meet the business need for the project.  Requirements may start out at a high level and become progressively more detailed as more information about the  requirements is known. Before being baselined, requirements need to be unambiguous (measurable and testable),  traceable, complete, consistent, and acceptable to key stakeholders. The format of the requirements document may  range from a simple document listing all the requirements categorized by stakeholder and priority, to more elaborate  forms containing an executive summary, detailed descriptions, and attachments.    Many organizations categorize requirements into different types, such as business and technical solutions, the  former referring to stakeholder needs and the latter as to how those needs will be implemented. Requirements can  be grouped into classiﬁcations allowing for further reﬁnement and detail as the requirements are elaborated. These  classiﬁcations include: Business requirements. These describe the higher-level needs of the organization as a whole, such as the  business issues or opportunities, and reasons why a project has been undertaken. Stakeholder requirements. These describe needs of a stakeholder or stakeholder group. Solution requirements. These describe features, functions, and characteristics of the product, service, or  result that will meet the business and stakeholder requirements. Solution requirements are further grouped into  functional and nonfunctional requirements: nuFunctional requirements. Functional requirements describe the behaviors of the product. Examples include  actions, processes, data, and interactions that the product should execute. nuNonfunctional requirements. Nonfunctional requirements supplement functional requirements and describe  the environmental conditions or qualities required for the product to be effective. Examples include: reliability,  security, performance, safety, level of service, supportability, retention/purge, etc. Transition and readiness requirements. These describe temporary capabilities, such as data conversion and  training requirements, needed to transition from the current as-is state to the desired future state. Project requirements. These describe the actions, processes, or other conditions the project needs to meet.  Examples include milestone dates, contractual obligations, constraints, etc. Quality requirements. These capture any condition or criteria needed to validate the successful completion  of a project deliverable or fulﬁllment of other project requirements. Examples include tests, certiﬁcations,  validations, etc., The requirements traceability matrix is a grid that links product requirements from their origin to the deliverables  that satisfy them. The implementation of a requirements traceability matrix helps ensure that each requirement adds  business value by linking it to the business and project objectives. It provides a means to track requirements throughout  the project life cycle, helping to ensure that requirements approved in the requirements documentation are delivered at  the end of the project. Finally, it provides a structure for managing changes to the product scope.       Tracing requirements includes but is not limited to: Business needs, opportunities, goals, and objectives; Project objectives; Project scope and WBS deliverables; Product design; Product development; Test strategy and test scenarios; and High-level requirements to more detailed requirements. Attributes associated with each requirement can be recorded in the requirements traceability matrix. These  attributes help to deﬁne key information about the requirement. Typical attributes used in the requirements traceability  matrix may include: a unique identiﬁer, a textual description of the requirement, the rationale for inclusion, owner,  source, priority, version, current status (such as active, cancelled, deferred, added, approved, assigned, completed),  and status date. Additional attributes to ensure that the requirement has met stakeholders’ satisfaction may include  stability, complexity, and acceptance criteria. Figure 5-7 provides an example of a requirements traceability matrix  with its associated attributes.

Example of a Requirements Traceability Matrix , Define Scope is the process of developing a detailed description of the project and product. The key benefit of  this process is that it describes the product, service, or result boundaries and acceptance criteria. The inputs, tools  and techniques, and outputs of this process are depicted in Figure 5-8. Figure 5-9 depicts the data flow diagram  of the process.

Define Scope: Data Flow Diagram Since all the requirements identiﬁed in Collect Requirements may not be included in the project, the Deﬁne Scope  process selects the ﬁnal project requirements from the requirements documentation developed during the Collect  Requirements process. It then develops a detailed description of the project and product, service, or result. The preparation of a detailed project scope statement builds upon the major deliverables, assumptions, and  constraints that are documented during project initiation. During project planning, the project scope is deﬁned and   described with greater speciﬁcity as more information about the project is known. Existing risks, assumptions, and  constraints are analyzed for completeness and added or updated as necessary. The Deﬁne Scope process can be highly  iterative. In iterative life cycle projects, a high-level vision will be developed for the overall project, but the detailed scope  is determined one iteration at a time, and the detailed planning for the next iteration is carried out as work progresses  on the current project scope and deliverables. , Described in Section 4.1.3.1. The project charter provides the high-level project description, product characteristics,  and approval requirements., Described in Section 4.2.3.1. A project management plan component includes but is not limited to the scope  management plan as described in Section 5.1.3.1, which documents how the project scope will be deﬁned, validated,  and controlled., Examples of project documents that can be considered as inputs for this process include but are not limited to: Assumption log. Described in Section 4.1.3.2. The assumption log identiﬁes assumptions and constraints about  the product, project, environment, stakeholders, and other factors that can inﬂuence the project and product scope. Requirements  documentation.  Described  in  Section  5.2.3.1.  Requirements  documentation  identiﬁes  requirements that will be incorporated into the scope. Risk register. Described in Section 11.2.3.1. The risk register contains response strategies that may affect the  project scope, such as reducing or changing project and product scope to avoid or mitigate a risk., The enterprise environmental factors that can inﬂuence the Deﬁne Scope process include but are not limited to: Organization’s culture, Infrastructure, Personnel administration, and Marketplace conditions., The organizational process assets that can inﬂuence the Deﬁne Scope process include but are not limited to: Policies, procedures, and templates for a project scope statement; Project ﬁles from previous projects; and Lessons learned from previous phases or projects.      , Described in Section 4.1.2.1. Expertise should be considered from individuals or groups with knowledge of or  experience with similar projects., An example of a data analysis technique that can be used in this process includes but is not limited to alternatives  analysis. Alternatives analysis can be used to evaluate ways to meet the requirements and the objectives identiﬁed in  the charter., Described in Section 5.1.2.2. A decision-making technique that can be used in this process includes but is not limited  to multicriteria decision analysis. Described in Section 8.1.2.4, multicriteria decision analysis is a technique that uses  a decision matrix to provide a systematic analytical approach for establishing criteria, such as requirements, schedule,  budget, and resources, in order to reﬁne the project and product scope for the project., Described in Section 4.1.2.3. An example of an interpersonal and team skills technique is facilitation. Facilitation  is used in workshops and working sessions with key stakeholders who have a variety of expectations or ﬁelds of  expertise. The goal is to reach a cross-functional and common understanding of the project deliverables and project  and product boundaries., Product analysis can be used to deﬁne products and services. It includes asking questions about a product or service  and forming answers to describe the use, characteristics, and other relevant aspects of what is going to be delivered.  Each application area has one or more generally accepted methods for translating high-level product or service  descriptions into meaningful deliverables. Requirements are captured at a high level and decomposed to the level of  detail needed to design the ﬁnal product. Examples of product analysis techniques include but are not limited to: Product breakdown, Requirements analysis, Systems analysis, Systems engineering, Value analysis, and Value engineering. , The project scope statement is the description of the project scope, major deliverables, assumptions, and constraints.  The project scope statement documents the entire scope, including project and product scope. It describes the project’s  deliverables in detail. It also provides a common understanding of the project scope among project stakeholders. It may  contain explicit scope exclusions that can assist in managing stakeholder expectations. It enables the project team  to perform more detailed planning, guides the project team’s work during execution, and provides the baseline for  evaluating whether requests for changes or additional work are contained within or outside the project’s boundaries. The degree and level of detail to which the project scope statement deﬁnes the work that will be performed and the  work that is excluded can help determine how well the project management team can control the overall project scope.  The detailed project scope statement, either directly or by reference to other documents, includes the following: Product scope description. Progressively elaborates the characteristics of the product, service, or result  described in the project charter and requirements documentation. Deliverables. Any unique and verifiable product, result, or capability to perform a service that is required  to be produced to complete a process, phase, or project. Deliverables also include ancillary results, such as  project management reports and documentation. These deliverables may be described at a summary level  or in great detail. Acceptance criteria. A set of conditions that is required to be met before deliverables are accepted. Project exclusions. Identiﬁes what is excluded from the project. Explicitly stating what is out of scope for the  project helps manage stakeholders’ expectations and can reduce scope creep. Although the project charter and the project scope statement are sometimes perceived as containing a certain  degree of redundancy, they are different in the level of detail contained in each. The project charter contains high- level information, while the project scope statement contains a detailed description of the scope components. These  components are progressively elaborated throughout the project. Table 5-1 describes some of the key elements for  each document.       Table 5-1.

The key beneﬁt of this process is that it provides a framework of what has to be delivered. This process is  performed once or at predeﬁned points in the project. The inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of this process are  depicted in Figure 5-10. Figure 5-11 depicts the data ﬂow diagram of the process.

Create WBS: Data Flow Diagram       The WBS is a hierarchical decomposition of the total scope of work to be carried out by the project team to accomplish  the project objectives and create the required deliverables. The WBS organizes and deﬁnes the total scope of the project  and represents the work speciﬁed in the current approved project scope statement. The planned work is contained within the lowest level of WBS components, which are called work packages. A work  package can be used to group the activities where work is scheduled and estimated, monitored, and controlled. In the  context of the WBS, work refers to work products or deliverables that are the result of activity and not to the activity itself., A project management plan component includes but is not limited to the scope management plan. Described in  Section 5.1.3.1, the scope management plan documents how the WBS will be created from the project scope statement., Examples of project documents that can be considered as inputs for this process include but are not limited to: Project scope statement. Described in Section 5.3.3.1. The project scope statement describes the work that  will be performed and the work that is excluded. Requirements documentation. Described in Section 5.2.3.1. Detailed requirements describe how individual  requirements meet the business need for the project., The enterprise environmental factors that can inﬂuence the Create WBS process include but are not limited to  industry-speciﬁc WBS standards that are relevant to the nature of the project. These industry-speciﬁc standards may  serve as external reference sources for creating the WBS. ,  The organizational process assets that can inﬂuence the Create WBS process include but are not limited to: Policies, procedures, and templates for the WBS; Project ﬁles from previous projects; and Lessons learned from previous projects. , Described in Section 4.1.2.1. Expertise should be considered from individuals or groups with knowledge of or  experience with similar projects., Decomposition is a technique used for dividing and subdividing the project scope and project deliverables into  smaller, more manageable parts. The work package is the work deﬁned at the lowest level of the WBS for which cost and  duration can be estimated and managed. The level of decomposition is often guided by the degree of control needed to  effectively manage the project. The level of detail for work packages will vary with the size and complexity of the project.  Decomposition of the total project work into work packages generally involves the following activities: Identifying and analyzing the deliverables and related work, Structuring and organizing the WBS, Decomposing the upper WBS levels into lower-level detailed components, Developing and assigning identiﬁcation codes to the WBS components, and Verifying that the degree of decomposition of the deliverables is appropriate. A portion of a WBS with some branches of the WBS decomposed down through the work package level is shown in  Figure 5-12. 1.0 Value Management System Project 1.1 1.2 1.3 1.4 Needs Standards Systems Project Assessment Development Engineering  Management 1.1.1 1.1.2 1.1.3 1.1.4 Current System Requirements Alternatives System Requirements Audit Determination Development Development 1.1.1.1 1.1.2.1 1.1.3.1 Components Gap Alternatives Identification Assessment Identification 1.1.1.2 1.1.2.2 1.1.3.2 Components Requirements Alternatives Analysis Changes Identification Analysis The WBS is illustrative only. It is not intended to represent the full project scope of any specific project,  nor to imply that this is the only way to organize a WBS on this type of project. Figure 5-12. Sample WBS Decomposed Down Through Work Packages       A WBS structure may be created through various approaches. Some of the popular methods include the top-down  approach, the use of organization-speciﬁc guidelines, and the use of WBS templates. A bottom-up approach can be used  to group subcomponents. The WBS structure can be represented in a number of forms, such as: Using phases of the project life cycle as the second level of decomposition, with the product and project  deliverables inserted at the third level, as shown in Figure 5-13; Using major deliverables as the second level of decomposition, as shown in Figure 5-14; and Incorporating subcomponents that may be developed by organizations outside the project team, such as  contracted work. The seller then develops the supporting contract WBS as part of the contracted work.

It is not intended to represent the full project scope of any specific project,  nor to imply that this is the only way to organize a WBS on this type of project. Figure 5-14. Sample WBS with Major Deliverables Decomposition of the upper-level WBS components requires subdividing the work for each of the deliverables or  subcomponents into its most fundamental components, where the WBS components represent veriﬁable products, services,  or results. If an agile approach is used, epics can be decomposed into user stories. The WBS may be structured as an  outline, an organizational chart, or other method that identiﬁes a hierarchical breakdown. Verifying the correctness of the  decomposition requires determining that the lower-level WBS components are those that are necessary and sufﬁcient for  completion of the corresponding higher-level deliverables. Different deliverables can have different levels of decomposition.  To arrive at a work package, the work for some deliverables needs to be decomposed only to the next level, while others need  additional levels of decomposition. As the work is decomposed to greater levels of detail, the ability to plan, manage, and  control the work is enhanced. However, excessive decomposition can lead to nonproductive management effort, inefﬁcient  use of resources, decreased efﬁciency in performing the work, and difﬁculty aggregating data over different levels of the WBS. Decomposition may not be possible for a deliverable or subcomponent that will be accomplished far into the future.  The project management team usually waits until the deliverable or subcomponent is agreed on, so the details of the  WBS can be developed. This technique is sometimes referred to as rolling wave planning.       The WBS represents all product and project work, including the project management work. The total of the work at  the lowest levels should roll up to the higher levels so that nothing is left out and no extra work is performed. This is  sometimes called the 100 percent rule. For speciﬁc information regarding the WBS, refer to the Practice Standard for Work Breakdown Structures – Second  Edition [15]. This standard contains industry-speciﬁc examples of WBS templates that can be tailored to speciﬁc projects  in a particular application area., The scope baseline is the approved version of a scope statement, WBS, and its associated WBS dictionary, which can  be changed only through formal change control procedures and is used as a basis for comparison. It is a component of  the project management plan. Components of the scope baseline include: Project scope statement. The project scope statement includes the description of the project scope, major  deliverables, assumptions, and constraints (Section 5.3.3.1). WBS. The WBS is a hierarchical decomposition of the total scope of work to be carried out by the project team  to accomplish the project objectives and create the required deliverables. Each descending level of the WBS  represents an increasingly detailed deﬁnition of the project work. Work package. The lowest level of the WBS is a work package with a unique identiﬁer. These identiﬁers provide  a structure for hierarchical summation of costs, schedule, and resource information and form a code of accounts.  Each work package is part of a control account. A control account is a management control point where scope,  budget, and schedule are integrated and compared to the earned value for performance measurement. A control  account has two or more work packages, though each work package is associated with a single control account. Planning package. A control account may include one or more planning packages. A planning package is a  work breakdown structure component below the control account and above the work package with known work  content but without detailed schedule activities.    WBS dictionary. The WBS dictionary is a document that provides detailed deliverable, activity, and scheduling  information about each component in the WBS. The WBS dictionary is a document that supports the WBS. Most  of the information included in the WBS dictionary is created by other processes and added to this document at a  later stage. Information in the WBS dictionary may include but is not limited to: nuCode of account identiﬁer, nuDescription of work, nuAssumptions and constraints, nuResponsible organization, nuSchedule milestones, nuAssociated schedule activities, nuResources required, nuCost estimates, nuQuality requirements, nuAcceptance criteria, nuTechnical references, and nuAgreement information., Project documents that may be updated as a result of carrying out this process include but are not limited to: nuAssumption log. Described in Section 4.1.3.2. The assumption log is updated with additional assumptions  or constraints that were identiﬁed during the Create WBS process. nuRequirements documentation. Described in Section 5.2.3.1. Requirements documentation may be updated  to include approved changes resulting from the Create WBS process.      , Validate Scope is the process of formalizing acceptance of the completed project deliverables. The key beneﬁt of this  process is that it brings objectivity to the acceptance process and increases the probability of ﬁnal product, service,  or result acceptance by validating each deliverable. This process is performed periodically throughout the project as  needed. The inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of this process are depicted in Figure 5-15. Figure 5-16 depicts  the data ﬂow diagram of the process.

Validate Scope: Data Flow Diagram The veriﬁed deliverables obtained from the Control Quality process are reviewed with the customer or sponsor to  ensure they are completed satisfactorily and have received formal acceptance of the deliverables by the customer or  sponsor. In this process, the outputs obtained as a result of the Planning processes in the Project Scope Management  Knowledge Area, such as the requirements documentation or the scope baseline, as well as the work performance data  obtained from the Execution processes in other Knowledge Areas, are the basis for performing the validation and for  ﬁnal acceptance. The Validate Scope process differs from the Control Quality process in that the former is primarily concerned with  acceptance of the deliverables, while the latter is primarily concerned with correctness of the deliverables and meeting  the quality requirements speciﬁed for the deliverables. Control Quality is generally performed before Validate Scope,  although the two processes may be performed in parallel.      , Described in Section 4.2.3.1. Project management plan components include but are not limited to: Scope management plan. Described in Section 5.1.3.1. The project management plan speciﬁes how formal  acceptance of the completed project deliverables will be obtained. Requirements management plan. Described in Section 5.1.3.2. The requirements management plan describes  how the project requirements are validated. Scope baseline. Described in Section 5.4.3.1. The scope baseline is compared to actual results to determine if  a change, corrective action, or preventive action is necessary., Project documents that can be considered as inputs for this process include but are not limited to: Lessons learned register: Described in Section 4.4.3.1. Lessons learned earlier in the project can be applied to  later phases in the project to improve the efﬁciency and effectiveness of validating deliverables. Quality reports. Described in Section 8.2.3.1. The information presented in the quality report may include  all quality assurance issues managed or escalated by the team, recommendations for improvement, and the  summary of ﬁndings from the Control Quality process. This information is reviewed prior to product acceptance. Requirements documentation. Described in Section 5.2.3.1. Requirements are compared to the actual results  to determine if a change, corrective action, or preventive action is necessary. Requirements traceability matrix. Described in Section 5.2.3.2. The requirements traceability matrix contains  information about requirements, including how they will be validated., Veriﬁed deliverables are project deliverables that are completed and checked for correctness through the Control  Quality process. , Described in Section 4.3.3.2. Work performance data can include the degree of compliance with requirements, number  of nonconformities, severity of the nonconformities, or the number of validation cycles performed in a period of time. , Described in Section 8.3.2.3. Inspection includes activities such as measuring, examining, and validating to  determine whether work and deliverables meet requirements and product acceptance criteria. Inspections are  sometimes called reviews, product reviews, and walkthroughs. In some application areas, these different terms have  unique and speciﬁc meanings., Described in Section 5.2.2.4. An example of decision making that may be used in this process includes but is  not limited to voting. Voting is used to reach a conclusion when the validation is performed by the project team  and other stakeholders., Deliverables that meet the acceptance criteria are formally signed off and approved by the customer or sponsor.  Formal documentation received from the customer or sponsor acknowledging formal stakeholder acceptance of the  project’s deliverables is forwarded to the Close Project or Phase process (Section 4.7)., Work performance information includes information about project progress, such as which deliverables have been  accepted and which have not been accepted and the reasons why. This information is documented as described in  Section 10.3.3.1 and communicated to stakeholders., The completed deliverables that have not been formally accepted are documented, along with the reasons for  non-acceptance of those deliverables. Those deliverables may require a change request for defect repair. The change  requests (described in Section 4.3.3.4) are processed for review and disposition through the Perform Integrated Change  Control process (Section 4.6).      , Project documents that may be updated as a result of carrying out this process include but are not limited to: Lessons learned register. Described in Section 4.4.3.1. The lessons learned register is updated with information  on challenges encountered and how they could have been avoided as well as approaches that worked well for  validating deliverables. Requirements documentation. Described in Section 5.2.3.1. The requirements documentation may be updated  with the actual results of validation activity. Of particular interest is when the actual results are better than the  requirement or where a requirement was waived. Requirements traceability matrix. Described in Section 5.2.3.2. The requirements traceability matrix is updated  with the results of the validation, including the method used and the outcome., Control Scope is the process of monitoring the status of the project and product scope and managing changes to  the scope baseline. The key beneﬁt of this process is that the scope baseline is maintained throughout the project. This  process is performed throughout the project. The inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of this process are depicted  in Figure 5-17. Figure 5-18 depicts the data ﬂow diagram of the process.

Control Scope: Data Flow Diagram Controlling the project scope ensures all requested changes and recommended corrective or preventive actions  are processed through the Perform Integrated Change Control process (see Section 4.6). Control Scope is also used  to manage the actual changes when they occur and is integrated with the other control processes. The uncontrolled  expansion to product or project scope without adjustments to time, cost, and resources is referred to as scope creep.  Change is inevitable; therefore, some type of change control process is mandatory for every project.      , Described in Section 4.2.3.1. Project management plan components include but are not limited to: Scope management plan. Described in Section 5.1.3.1. The scope management plan documents how the  project and product scope will be controlled. Requirements management plan. Described in Section 5.1.3.2. The requirements management plan describes  how the project requirements will be managed. Change management plan. Described in Section 4.2.3.1. The change management plan deﬁnes the process  for managing change on the project. Configuration management plan. Described in Section 4.2.3.1. The conﬁguration management plan deﬁnes  those items that are conﬁgurable, those items that require formal change control, and the process for controlling  changes to such items. Scope baseline. Described in Section 5.4.3.1. The scope baseline is compared to actual results to determine if  a change, corrective action, or preventive action is necessary. Performance measurement baseline. Described in Section 4.2.3.1. When using earned value analysis, the  performance measurement baseline is compared to actual results to determine if a change, corrective action, or  preventive action is necessary., Project documents that can be considered as inputs for this process include but are not limited to: Lessons learned register. Described in Section 4.4.3.1. Lessons learned earlier in the project can be applied to  later phases in the project to improve scope control. Requirements documentation. Described in Section 5.2.3.1. Requirements documentation is used to detect  any deviation in the agreed-upon scope for the project or product.  Requirements traceability matrix. Described in Section 5.2.3.2. The requirements traceability matrix helps   to detect the impact of any change or deviation from the scope baseline on the project objectives. It may also  provide status of requirements being controlled., Work performance data can include the number of change requests received, the number of requests accepted, and  the number of deliverables veriﬁed, validated, and completed. , The organizational process assets that can inﬂuence the Control Scope process include but are not limited to: Existing formal and informal scope, control-related policies, procedures, guidelines; and Monitoring and reporting methods and templates to be used., Data analysis techniques that can be used in the Control Scope process include but are not limited to: Variance analysis. Described in Section 4.5.2.2. Variance analysis is used to compare the baseline to the actual  results and determine if the variance is within the threshold amount or if corrective or preventive action is  appropriate. Trend analysis. Described in Section 4.5.2.2. Trend analysis examines project performance over time to  determine if performance is improving or deteriorating. Important aspects of project scope control include determining the cause and degree of variance relative to the scope  baseline (Section 5.4.3.1) and deciding whether corrective or preventive action is required., Work performance information produced includes correlated and contextualized information on how the project  and product scope are performing compared to the scope baseline. It can include the categories of the changes  received, the identiﬁed scope variances and their causes, how they impact schedule or cost, and the forecast of the  future scope performance., Described in Section 4.3.3.4. Analysis of project performance may result in a change request to the scope and  schedule baselines or other components of the project management plan. Change requests are processed for review  and disposition through the Perform Integrated Change Control process (Section 4.6).      , Any change to the project management plan goes through the organization’s change control process via a change  request. Components that may require a change request for the project management plan include but are not limited to: Scope management plan. Described in Section 5.1.3.1. The scope management plan may be updated to reﬂect  a change in how the scope is managed. Scope baseline. Described in Section 5.4.3.1. Changes to the scope baseline are incorporated in response to  approved changes in scope, scope statement, the WBS, or the WBS dictionary. In some cases, scope variances can  be so severe that a revised scope baseline is needed to provide a realistic basis for performance measurement. Schedule baseline. Described in Section 6.5.3.1. Changes to the schedule baseline are incorporated in response  to approved changes in scope, resources, or schedule estimates. In some cases, schedule variances can be so  severe that a revised schedule baseline is needed to provide a realistic basis for performance measurement. Cost baseline. Described in Section 7.3.3.1. Changes to the cost baseline are incorporated in response to  approved changes in scope, resources, or cost estimates. In some cases, cost variances can be so severe that a  revised cost baseline is needed to provide a realistic basis for performance measurement. Performance measurement baseline. Described in Section 4.2.3.1. Changes to the performance measurement  baseline are incorporated in response to approved changes in scope, schedule performance, or cost estimates.  In some cases, the performance variances can be so severe that a change request is put forth to revise the  performance measurement baseline to provide a realistic basis for performance measurement. , Project documents that may be updated as a result of carrying out this process include but are not limited to: Lessons learned register. Described in Section 4.4.3.1. The lessons learned register can be updated with  techniques that are efﬁcient and effective in controlling scope, including causes of variances and corrective  actions chosen. Requirements documentation. Described in Section 5.2.3.1. Requirements documentation may be updated   with additional or changed requirements.  Requirements traceability matrix. Described in Section 5.2.3.2. The requirements traceability matrix may be  updated to reﬂect updates in requirement documentation. , Project Schedule Management includes the processes required to manage the timely completion of the project.   The Project Schedule Management processes are: 6.1 Plan Schedule Management—The process of establishing the policies, procedures, and documentation for  planning, developing, managing, executing, and controlling the project schedule. 6.2 Define Activities—The process of identifying and documenting the speciﬁc actions to be performed to produce  the project deliverables. 6.3 Sequence Activities—The process of identifying and documenting relationships among the project activities. 6.4 Estimate Activity Durations—The process of estimating the number of work periods needed to complete  individual activities with the estimated resources. 6.5 Develop Schedule—The process of analyzing activity sequences, durations, resource requirements, and  schedule constraints to create the project schedule model for project execution and monitoring and controlling. 6.6 Control Schedule—The process of monitoring the status of the project to update the project schedule and  manage changes to the schedule baseline. Figure 6-1 provides an overview of the Project Schedule Management processes. The Project Schedule Management  processes are presented as discrete processes with deﬁned interfaces while, in practice, they overlap and interact in  ways that cannot be completely detailed in the PMBOK® .

Project Schedule Management Overview      , Plan Schedule Management is the process of establishing the policies, procedures, and documentation for  planning, developing, managing, executing, and controlling the project schedule. The key beneﬁt of this process is  that it provides guidance and direction on how the project schedule will be managed throughout the project. This  process is performed once or at predeﬁned points in the project. The inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of the  process are depicted in Figure 6-3. Figure 6-4 depicts the data ﬂow diagram for the process.

Plan Schedule Management: Data Flow Diagram , Described in Section 4.1.3.1. The project charter deﬁnes the summary milestone schedule that will inﬂuence the  management of the project schedule., Described in Section 4.3.2.1. Project management plan components include but are not limited to: Scope management plan. Described in Section 5.1.3.1. The scope management plan describes how the scope  will be deﬁned and developed, which will provide information on how the schedule will be developed. Development approach. Described in Section 4.2.3.1. The product development approach will help deﬁne the  scheduling approach, estimating techniques, scheduling tools, and techniques for controlling the schedule., The enterprise environmental factors that can inﬂuence the Plan Schedule Management process include but are not  limited to: Organizational culture and structure, Team resource availability and skills and physical resource availability, Scheduling software, lines and criteria for tailoring the organization’s set of standard processes and procedures to satisfy the  speciﬁc needs of the project, and Commercial databases, such as standardized estimating data., The organizational process assets that can inﬂuence the Plan Schedule Management process include but are not  limited to: Historical information and lessons learned repositories; Existing formal and informal schedule development, management- and control-related policies, procedures,   and guidelines; Templates and forms; and Monitoring and reporting tools.      , Described in Section 4.1.2.1 Expertise should be considered from individuals or groups with specialized knowledge  or training in previous, similar projects: Schedule development, management, and control; Scheduling methodologies (e.g., predictive or adaptive life cycle); Scheduling software; and The speciﬁc industry for which the project is developed., A data analysis technique that can be used for this process includes but is not limited to alternatives analysis.  Alternatives analysis can include determining which schedule methodology to use, or how to combine various  methods on the project. It can also include determining how detailed the schedule needs to be, the duration of  waves for rolling wave planning, and how often it should be reviewed and updated. An appropriate balance between  the level of detail needed to manage the schedule and the amount of time it takes to keep it up to date needs to be  reached for each project., Project teams may hold planning meetings to develop the schedule management plan. Participants at these meetings  may include the project manager, the project sponsor, selected project team members, selected stakeholders, anyone  with responsibility for schedule planning or execution, and others as needed., The schedule management plan is a component of the project management plan that establishes the criteria  and the activities for developing, monitoring, and controlling the schedule. The schedule management plan may be  formal or informal, highly detailed, or broadly framed based on the needs of the project, and includes appropriate  control thresholds.  The schedule management plan can establish the following: Project schedule model development. The scheduling methodology and the scheduling tool to be used in the  development of the project schedule model are speciﬁed. Release and iteration length. When using an adaptive life cycle, the time-boxed periods for releases, waves,  and iterations are speciﬁed. Time-boxed periods are durations during which the team works steadily toward  completion of a goal. Time-boxing helps to minimize scope creep as it forces the teams to process essential  features ﬁrst, then other features when time permits. Level of accuracy. The level of accuracy speciﬁes the acceptable range used in determining realistic activity  duration estimates and may include an amount for contingencies. Units of measure. Each unit of measurement (such as staff hours, staff days, or weeks for time measures, or  meters, liters, tons, kilometers, or cubic yards for quantity measures) is deﬁned for each of the resources. Organizational procedures links. The work breakdown structure (WBS) (Section 5.4) provides the framework  for the schedule management plan, allowing for consistency with the estimates and resulting schedules. Project schedule model maintenance. The process used to update the status and record progress of the  project in the schedule model during the execution of the project is deﬁned. Control thresholds. Variance thresholds for monitoring schedule performance may be speciﬁed to indicate an  agreed-upon amount of variation to be allowed before some action needs to be taken. Thresholds are typically  expressed as percentage deviations from the parameters established in the baseline plan. Rules of performance measurement. Earned value management (EVM) rules or other physical measurement  rules of performance measurement are set. For example, the schedule management plan may specify: nuRules for establishing percent complete, nuEVM techniques (e.g., baselines, ﬁxed-formula, percent complete, etc.) to be employed (for more speciﬁc  information, refer to the Practice Standard for Earned Value Management [17]), and nuSchedule performance measurements such as schedule variance (SV) and schedule performance index (SPI)  used to assess the magnitude of variation to the original schedule baseline. Reporting formats. The formats and frequency for the various schedule reports are deﬁned.      , Deﬁne Activities is the process of identifying and documenting the speciﬁc actions to be performed to produce  the project deliverables. The key beneﬁt of this process is that it decomposes work packages into schedule activities  that provide a basis for estimating, scheduling, executing, monitoring, and controlling the project work. This process  is performed throughout the project. The inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of this process are depicted in   Figure 6-5. Figure 6-6 depicts the data ﬂow diagram of the process.

Define Activities: Data Flow Diagram , Described in Section 4.2.3.1. Project management plan components include but are not limited to: Schedule management plan. Described in Section 6.1.3.1. The schedule management plan deﬁnes the  schedule methodology, the duration of waves for rolling wave planning, and the level of detail necessary to  manage the work. Scope baseline. Described in Section 5.4.3.1. The project WBS, deliverables, constraints, and assumptions  documented in the scope baseline are considered explicitly while deﬁning activities., Enterprise environmental factors that inﬂuence the Deﬁne Activities process include but are not limited to: Organizational cultures and structure, Published commercial information from commercial databases, and Project management information system (PMIS)., The organizational process assets that can inﬂuence the Deﬁne Activities process include but are not limited to: Lessons learned repository containing historical information regarding activity lists used by previous similar projects, Standardized processes, Templates that contain a standard activity list or a portion of an activity list from a previous project, and Existing formal and informal activity planning-related policies, procedures, and guidelines, such as the scheduling  methodology, that are considered in developing the activity deﬁnitions., Described in Section 4.1.2.1. Expertise should be considered from individuals or groups with specialized knowledge  of similar past projects and the work being performed.      , Described in Section 5.4.2.2. Decomposition is a technique used for dividing and subdividing the project scope and  project deliverables into smaller, more manageable parts. Activities represent the effort needed to complete a work  package. The Deﬁne Activities process deﬁnes the ﬁnal outputs as activities rather than deliverables, as done in the  Create WBS process (Section 5.4). The activity list, WBS, and WBS dictionary can be developed either sequentially or concurrently, with the WBS and WBS  dictionary used as the basis for development of the ﬁnal activity list. Each work package within the WBS is decomposed  into the activities required to produce the work package deliverables. Involving team members in the decomposition can  lead to better and more accurate results., Rolling wave planning is an iterative planning technique in which the work to be accomplished in the near term is  planned in detail, while work further in the future is planned at a higher level. It is a form of progressive elaboration  applicable to work packages, planning packages, and release planning when using an agile or waterfall approach.  Therefore, work can exist at various levels of detail depending on where it is in the project life cycle. During early  strategic planning when information is less deﬁned, work packages may be decomposed to the known level of detail. As  more is known about the upcoming events in the near term, work packages can be decomposed into activities., Meetings may be face-to-face, virtual, formal, or informal. Meetings may be held with team members or subject  matter experts to deﬁne the activities needed to complete the work., The activity list includes the schedule activities required on the project. For projects that use rolling wave planning  or agile techniques, the activity list will be updated periodically as the project progresses. The activity list includes  an activity identiﬁer and a scope of work description for each activity in sufﬁcient detail to ensure that project team  members understand what work is required to be completed. , Activity attributes extend the description of the activity by identifying multiple components associated with each  activity. The components for each activity evolve over time. During the initial stages of the project, they include  the unique activity identiﬁer (ID), WBS ID, and activity label or name. When completed, they may include activity  descriptions, predecessor activities, successor activities, logical relationships, leads and lags (Section 6.3.2.3),  resource requirements, imposed dates, constraints, and assumptions. Activity attributes can be used to identify the  place where the work has to be performed, the project calendar the activity is assigned to, and the type of effort  involved. Activity attributes are used for schedule development and for selecting, ordering, and sorting the planned  schedule activities in various ways within reports, A milestone is a signiﬁcant point or event in a project. A milestone list identiﬁes all project milestones and indicates  whether the milestone is mandatory, such as those required by contract, or optional, such as those based on historical  information. Milestones have zero duration because they represent a signiﬁcant point or event., Described in Section 4.3.3.4. Once the project has been baselined, the progressive elaboration of deliverables into  activities may reveal work that was not initially part of the project baselines. This may result in a change request.  Change requests are processed for review and disposition through the Perform Integrated Change Control process  (Section 4.6)., Any change to the project management plan goes through the organization’s change control process via a change  request. Components that may require a change request for the project management plan include but are not limited to: Schedule baseline. Described in Section 6.5.3.1. Throughout the project, work packages are progressively  elaborated into activities. This process may reveal work that was not part of the initial schedule baseline,  necessitating a change to delivery dates or other significant schedule milestones that are part of the  schedule baseline. Cost baseline. Described in Section 7.3.3.1. Changes to the cost baseline are incorporated in response to  approved changes in schedule activities.      , Sequence Activities is the process of identifying and documenting relationships among the project activities. The key  beneﬁt of this process is that it deﬁnes the logical sequence of work to obtain the greatest efﬁciency given all project  constraints. This process is performed throughout the project. The inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of this  process are depicted in Figure 6-7. Figure 6-8 depicts the data ﬂow diagram of the process.

Sequence Activities: Data Flow Diagram  Every activity except the ﬁrst and last should be connected to at least one predecessor and at least one successor  activity with an appropriate logical relationship. Logical relationships should be designed to create a realistic project  schedule. It may be necessary to use lead or lag time between activities to support a realistic and achievable project  schedule. Sequencing can be performed by using project management software or by using manual or automated  techniques. The Sequence Activities process concentrates on converting the project activities from a list to a diagram to  act as a ﬁrst step to publish the schedule baseline., Described in Section 4.2.3.1. Project management plan components include but are not limited to: Schedule management plan. Described in Section 6.1.3.1. The schedule management plan deﬁnes the method  used and the level of accuracy along with other criteria required to sequence activities. Scope baseline. Described in Section 5.4.3.1. The project WBS, deliverables, constraints, and assumptions  documented in the scope baseline are considered explicitly while sequencing activities., Project documents that can be considered as inputs for this process include but are not limited to: Activity attributes. Described in Section 6.2.3.2. Activity attributes may describe a necessary sequence of  events or deﬁned predecessor or successor relationships, as well as deﬁned lead and lag and logical relationships  between the activities. Activity list. Described in Section 6.2.3.1. The activity list contains all schedule activities required on the project  that are to be sequenced. Dependencies and other constraints for these activities can inﬂuence the sequencing  of the activities. Assumption log. Described in Section 4.1.3.2. Assumptions and constraints recorded in the assumption log may  inﬂuence the way activities are sequenced, the relationship between activities, and the need for leads and lags,  and may give rise to individual project risks that may impact the project schedule. Milestone list. Described in Section 6.2.3.3. The milestone list may have scheduled dates for speciﬁc milestones,  which may inﬂuence the way activities are sequenced.      , The enterprise environmental factors that can inﬂuence the Sequence Activities process include but are not limited to: Government or industry standards, Project management information system (PMIS), Scheduling tools, and Organization work authorization systems., The organizational process assets that can inﬂuence the Sequence Activities process include but are not limited to: Portfolio and program plans and project dependencies and relationships; Existing formal and informal activity planning-related policies, procedures, and guidelines, such as the scheduling  methodology that is considered in developing logical relationships; Templates that can be used to expedite the preparation of networks for project activities. Related activity attributes  information in templates can also contain additional descriptive information useful in sequencing activities; and Lessons learned repository containing historical information that can help optimize the sequencing process., The precedence diagramming method (PDM) is a technique used for constructing a schedule model in which activities  are represented by nodes and are graphically linked by one or more logical relationships to show the sequence in which  the activities are to be performed. PDM includes four types of dependencies or logical relationships. A predecessor activity is an activity that logically  comes before a dependent activity in a schedule. A successor activity is a dependent activity that logically comes after  another activity in a schedule. These relationships are deﬁned below and are illustrated in Figure 6-9:  Finish-to-start (FS). A logical relationship in which a successor activity cannot start until a predecessor activity  has ﬁnished. For example, installing the operating system on a PC (successor) cannot start until the PC hardware  is assembled (predecessor). Finish-to-finish (FF). A logical relationship in which a successor activity cannot ﬁnish until a predecessor activity  has ﬁnished. For example, writing a document (predecessor) is required to ﬁnish before editing the document  (successor) can ﬁnish. Start-to-start (SS). A logical relationship in which a successor activity cannot start until a predecessor activity  has started. For example, level concrete (successor) cannot begin until pour foundation (predecessor) begins. Start-to-finish (SF). A logical relationship in which a successor activity cannot ﬁnish until a predecessor activity  has started. For example, a new accounts payable system (successor) has to start before the old accounts  payable system can be shut down (predecessor). In PDM, FS is the most commonly used type of precedence relationship. The SF relationship is very rarely used, but  is included to present a complete list of the PDM relationship types. Two activities can have two logical relationships at the same time (for example, SS and FF). Multiple relationships  between the same activities are not recommended, so a decision has to be made to select the relationship with the  highest impact. Closed loops are also not recommended in logical relationships.

Precedence Diagramming Method (PDM) Relationship Types      , Dependencies may be characterized by the following attributes: mandatory or discretionary, internal or external  (as described below). Dependency has four attributes, but two can be applicable at the same time in the following  ways: mandatory external dependencies, mandatory internal dependencies, discretionary external dependencies, or  discretionary internal dependencies. Mandatory dependencies. Mandatory dependencies are those that are legally or contractually required or  inherent in the nature of the work. Mandatory dependencies often involve physical limitations, such as on a  construction project, where it is impossible to erect the superstructure until after the foundation has been built,  or on an electronics project, where a prototype has to be built before it can be tested. Mandatory dependencies  are sometimes referred to as hard logic or hard dependencies. Technical dependencies may not be mandatory.  The project team determines which dependencies are mandatory during the process of sequencing the activities.  Mandatory dependencies should not be confused with assigning schedule constraints in the scheduling tool. Discretionary dependencies. Discretionary dependencies are sometimes referred to as preferred logic,  preferential logic, or soft logic. Discretionary dependencies are established based on knowledge of best  practices within a particular application area or some unusual aspect of the project where a speciﬁc sequence  is desired, even though there may be other acceptable sequences. For example, generally accepted best  practices recommend that during construction, the electrical work should start after ﬁnishing the plumbing  work. This order is not mandatory and both activities may occur at the same time (in parallel), but performing  the activities in sequential order reduces the overall project risk. Discretionary dependencies should be fully  documented since they can create arbitrary total ﬂoat values and can limit later scheduling options. When fast  tracking techniques are employed, these discretionary dependencies should be reviewed and considered for  modiﬁcation or removal. The project team determines which dependencies are discretionary during the process  of sequencing the activities.  External dependencies. External dependencies involve a relationship between project activities and non- project activities. These dependencies are usually outside of the project team’s control. For example, the  testing activity in a software project may be dependent on the delivery of hardware from an external source, or  governmental environmental hearings may need to be held before site preparation can begin on a construction  project. The project management team determines which dependencies are external during the process of  sequencing the activities. Internal dependencies. Internal dependencies involve a precedence relationship between project activities and  are generally inside the project team’s control. For example, if the team cannot test a machine until they assemble  it, there is an internal mandatory dependency. The project management team determines which dependencies  are internal during the process of sequencing the activities., A lead is the amount of time a successor activity can be advanced with respect to a predecessor activity. For example,  on a project to construct a new ofﬁce building, the landscaping could be scheduled to start 2 weeks prior to the scheduled  punch list completion. This would be shown as a ﬁnish-to-start with a 2-week lead as shown in Figure 6-10. Lead is often  represented as a negative value for lag in scheduling software. Complete Write Punch List Draft FS – 2 Weeks (Lead) SS – 15 Days (Lag) Landscape Edit Building Lot Draft Figure 6-10. Examples of Lead and Lag       A lag is the amount of time a successor activity will be delayed with respect to a predecessor activity. For example,  a technical writing team may begin editing the draft of a large document 15 days after they begin writing it. This can be  shown as a start-to-start relationship with a 15-day lag as shown in Figure 6-10. Lag can also be represented in project  schedule network diagrams as shown in Figure 6-11 in the relationship between activities H and I (as indicated by the  nomenclature SS+10 (start-to-start plus 10 days lag) even though the offset is not shown relative to a timescale). The project management team determines the dependencies that may require a lead or a lag to accurately deﬁne the  logical relationship. The use of leads and lags should not replace schedule logic. Also, duration estimates do not include  any leads or lags. Activities and their related assumptions should be documented., Described in Section 4.3.2.2. Project management information systems includes scheduling software that has the  capability to help plan, organize, and adjust the sequence of the activities; insert the logical relationships, lead and lag  values; and differentiate the different types of dependencies. , A project schedule network diagram is a graphical representation of the logical relationships, also referred to as  dependencies, among the project schedule activities. Figure 6-11 illustrates a project schedule network diagram. A  project schedule network diagram is produced manually or by using project management software. It can include full  project details, or have one or more summary activities. A summary narrative can accompany the diagram and describe  the basic approach used to sequence the activities. Any unusual activity sequences within the network should be fully  described within the narrative. Activities that have multiple predecessor activities indicate a path convergence. Activities that have multiple successor  activities indicate a path divergence. Activities with divergence and convergence are at greater risk as they are affected  by multiple activities or can affect multiple activities. Activity I is called a path convergence, as it has more than one  predecessor, while activity K is called a path divergence, as it has more than one successor., Project documents that may be updated as a result of carrying out this process include but are not limited to: Activity attributes. Described in Section 6.2.3.2. Activity attributes may describe a necessary sequence of  events or deﬁned predecessor or successor relationships, as well as deﬁned lead and lag and logical relationships  between the activities. Activity list. Described in Section 6.2.3.1. The activity list may be impacted by the change in relationships  among the project activities during the sequencing activities. Assumption log. Described in Section 4.1.3.2. Assumptions and constraints recorded in the assumption log may  need to be updated based on the sequencing, relationship determination, and leads and lags, and may give rise  to individual project risks that may impact the project schedule. Milestone list. Described in Section 6.2.3.3. The scheduled dates for speciﬁc milestones may be impacted by  changes in relationships among the project activities during the sequencing activities.      , Estimate Activity Durations is the process of estimating the number of work periods needed to complete individual  activities with estimated resources. The key beneﬁt of this process is that it provides the amount of time each activity  will take to complete. This process is performed throughout the project. The inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of  this process are depicted in Figure 6-12. Figure 6-13 depicts the data ﬂow diagram of the process.

Estimate Activity Durations: Data Flow Diagram Estimating activity durations uses information from the scope of work, required resource types or skill levels,  estimated resource quantities, and resource calendars. Other factors that may inﬂuence the duration estimates include  constraints imposed on the duration, effort involved, or type of resources (e.g., ﬁxed duration, ﬁxed effort or work, ﬁxed  number of resources), as well as the schedule network analysis technique used. The inputs for the estimates of duration  originate from the person or group on the project team who is most familiar with the nature of the work in the speciﬁc  activity. The duration estimate is progressively elaborated, and the process considers the quality and availability of the  input data. For example, as more detailed and precise data are available about the project engineering and design work,  the accuracy and quality of the duration estimates improve.       The Estimate Activity Durations process requires an estimation of the amount of work effort required to complete  the activity and the amount of available resources estimated to complete the activity. These estimates are used to  approximate the number of work periods (activity duration) needed to complete the activity using the appropriate project  and resource calendars. In many cases, the number of resources that are expected to be available to accomplish an  activity, along with the skill proﬁciency of those resources, may determine the activity’s duration. A change to a driving  resource allocated to the activity will usually have an effect on the duration, but this is not a simple “straight-line” or  linear relationship. Sometimes, the intrinsic nature of the work (i.e., constraints imposed on the duration, effort involved,  or number of resources) will take a predetermined amount of time to complete regardless of the resource allocation  (e.g., a 24-hour stress test). Other factors for consideration when estimating duration include: Law of diminishing returns. When one factor (e.g., resource) used to determine the effort required to produce a  unit of work is increased while all other factors remain ﬁxed, a point will eventually be reached at which additions  of that one factor start to yield progressively smaller or diminishing increases in output. Number of resources. Increasing the number of resources to twice the original number of the resources does  not always reduce the time by half, as it may increase extra duration due to risk, and at some point adding  too many resources to the activity may increase duration due to knowledge transfer, learning curve, additional  coordination, and other factors involved. Advances in technology. This may also play an important role in determining duration estimates. For example, an  increase in the output of a manufacturing plant may be achieved by procuring the latest advances in technology,  which may impact duration and resource needs. Motivation of staff. The project manager also needs to be aware of Student Syndrome—or procrastination— when people start to apply themselves only at the last possible moment before the deadline, and Parkinson’s Law  where work expands to ﬁll the time available for its completion. All data and assumptions that support duration estimating are documented for each activity duration estimate. , Described in Section 4.2.3.1. Project management plan components include but are not limited to: Schedule management plan. Described in Section 6.1.3.1. The schedule management plan deﬁnes the method  used, as well as the level of accuracy and other criteria required to estimate activity durations. Scope baseline. Described in Section 5.4.3.1. The scope baseline includes the WBS dictionary, which contains  technical details that can inﬂuence the effort and duration estimates., Project documents that can be considered as inputs for this process include but are not limited to: Activity attributes. Described in Section 6.2.3.2. Activity attributes may describe deﬁned predecessor or  successor relationships, as well as deﬁned lead and lag and logical relationships between the activities that may  impact duration estimates. Activity list. Described in Section 6.2.3.1. The activity list contains all schedule activities required on the  project, which are to be estimated. Dependencies and other constraints for these activities can inﬂuence the  duration estimates. Assumption log. Described in Section 4.1.3.2. Assumptions and constraints recorded in the assumption log may  give rise to individual project risks that may impact the project schedule. Lessons learned register. Described in Section 4.4.3.1. Lessons learned earlier in the project with regard to  effort and duration estimating can be applied to later phases in the project to improve the accuracy and precision  of effort and duration estimates. Milestone list. Described in Section 6.2.3.3. The milestone list may have scheduled dates for speciﬁc milestones  that may impact the duration estimates. Project team assignments. Described in Section 9.3.3.1. The project is staffed when the appropriate people  have been assigned to the team. Resource breakdown structure. Described in Section 9.2.3.3. The resource breakdown structure provides a  hierarchical structure of the identiﬁed resources by resource category and resource type.       Resource calendars. Described in Section 9.2.1.2. The resource calendars inﬂuence the duration of schedule  activities due to the availability of speciﬁc resources, type of resources, and resources with speciﬁc attributes.  Resource calendars specify when and how long identiﬁed project resources will be available during the project. Resource requirements. Described in Section 9.2.3.1. The estimated activity resource requirements will have  an effect on the duration of the activity, since the level to which the resources assigned to the activity meet  the requirements will signiﬁcantly inﬂuence the duration of most activities. For example, if additional or lower- skilled resources are assigned to an activity, there may be reduced efﬁciency or productivity due to increased  communication, training, and coordination needs leading to a longer duration estimate. Risk register. Described in Section 11.2.3.1. Individual project risks may impact resource selection and  availability. Updates to the risk register are included with project documents updates, described in Section  11.5.3.2, from Plan Risk Responses., The enterprise environmental factors that can inﬂuence the Estimate Activity Durations process include but are not  limited to: Duration estimating databases and other reference data, Productivity metrics, Published commercial information, and Location of team members., The organizational process assets that can inﬂuence the Estimate Activity Durations process include but are not  limited to: Historical duration information, Project calendars, Estimating policies, Scheduling methodology, and Lessons learned repository. , Described in Section 4.1.2.1. Expertise should be considered from individuals or groups with specialized knowledge  or training in the following topics: Schedule development, management, and control; Expertise in estimating; and Discipline or application knowledge., Analogous estimating is a technique for estimating the duration or cost of an activity or a project using historical  data from a similar activity or project. Analogous estimating uses parameters from a previous, similar project, such as  duration, budget, size, weight, and complexity, as the basis for estimating the same parameter or measure for a future  project. When estimating durations, this technique relies on the actual duration of previous, similar projects as the basis  for estimating the duration of the current project. It is a gross value estimating approach, sometimes adjusted for known  differences in project complexity. Analogous duration estimating is frequently used to estimate project duration when  there is a limited amount of detailed information about the project. Analogous estimating is generally less costly and less time-consuming than other techniques, but it is also  less accurate. Analogous duration estimates can be applied to a total project or to segments of a project and may  be used in conjunction with other estimating methods. Analogous estimating is most reliable when the previous  activities are similar in fact and not just in appearance, and the project team members preparing the estimates  have the needed expertise., Parametric estimating is an estimating technique in which an algorithm is used to calculate cost or duration based  on historical data and project parameters. Parametric estimating uses a statistical relationship between historical data  and other variables (e.g., square footage in construction) to calculate an estimate for activity parameters, such as cost,  budget, and duration.       Durations can be quantitatively determined by multiplying the quantity of work to be performed by the number of labor  hours per unit of work. For example, duration on a design project is estimated by the number of drawings multiplied by  the number of labor hours per drawing, or on a cable installation, the meters of cable multiplied by the number of labor  hours per meter. If the assigned resource is capable of installing 25 meters of cable per hour, the duration required to  install 1,000 meters is 40 hours (1,000 meters divided by 25 meters per hour). This technique can produce higher levels of accuracy depending on the sophistication and underlying data built into  the model. Parametric schedule estimates can be applied to a total project or to segments of a project, in conjunction  with other estimating methods., The accuracy of single-point duration estimates may be improved by considering estimation uncertainty and risk.  Using three-point estimates helps deﬁne an approximate range for an activity’s duration: Most likely (tM). This estimate is based on the duration of the activity, given the resources likely to be assigned,  their productivity, realistic expectations of availability for the activity, dependencies on other participants, and  interruptions. Optimistic (tO). The activity duration based on analysis of the best-case scenario for the activity. Pessimistic (tP). The duration based on analysis of the worst-case scenario for the activity. Depending on the assumed distribution of values within the range of the three estimates, the expected duration, tE,  can be calculated. One commonly used formula is triangular distribution: tE = (tO + tM + tP) / 3. Triangular distribution is used when there is insufﬁcient historical data or when using judgmental data. Duration  estimates based on three points with an assumed distribution provide an expected duration and clarify the range of  uncertainty around the expected duration. , Bottom-up estimating is a method of estimating project duration or cost by aggregating the estimates of the lower- level components of the WBS. When an activity’s duration cannot be estimated with a reasonable degree of conﬁdence,  the work within the activity is decomposed into more detail. The detail durations are estimated. These estimates are  then aggregated into a total quantity for each of the activity’s durations. Activities may or may not have dependencies  between them that can affect the application and use of resources. If there are dependencies, this pattern of resource  usage is reﬂected and documented in the estimated requirements of the activity., Data analysis techniques that can be used for this process include but are not limited to: Alternatives analysis. Alternatives analysis is used to compare various levels of resource capability or skills;  scheduling compression techniques (described in Section 6.5.2.6); different tools (manual versus automated);  and make, rent, or buy decisions regarding the resources. This allows the team to weigh resource, cost, and  duration variables to determine an optimal approach for accomplishing project work. Reserve analysis. Reserve analysis is used to determine the amount of contingency and management reserve  needed for the project. Duration estimates may include contingency reserves, sometimes referred to as schedule  reserves, to account for schedule uncertainty. Contingency reserves are the estimated duration within the schedule  baseline, which is allocated for identiﬁed risks that are accepted. Contingency reserves are associated with the  known-unknowns, which may be estimated to account for this unknown amount of rework. The contingency  reserve may be a percentage of the estimated activity duration or a ﬁxed number of work periods. Contingency  reserves may be separated from the individual activities and aggregated. As more precise information about the  project becomes available, the contingency reserve may be used, reduced, or eliminated. Contingency should be  clearly identiﬁed in the schedule documentation. Estimates may also be produced for the amount of management reserve of schedule for the project. Management  reserves are a speciﬁed amount of the project budget withheld for management control purposes and are  reserved for unforeseen work that is within scope of the project. Management reserves are intended to address  the unknown-unknowns that can affect a project. Management reserve is not included in the schedule baseline,  but it is part of the overall project duration requirements. Depending on contract terms, use of management  reserves may require a change to the schedule baseline.      , Described in Section 5.2.2.4. Decision-making techniques that can be used in this process include but are not limited  to voting. One variation of the voting method that is often used in agile-based projects is called the ﬁst of ﬁve (also called  ﬁst to ﬁve). In this technique, the project manager asks the team to show their level of support for a decision by holding  up a closed ﬁst (indicating no support) up to ﬁve ﬁngers (indicating full support). If a team member holds up fewer than  three ﬁngers, the team member is given the opportunity to discuss any objections with the team. The project manager  continues the ﬁst-of-ﬁve process until the team achieves consensus (everyone holds up three or more ﬁngers) or agrees  to move on to the next decision., The project team may hold meetings to estimate activity durations. When using an agile approach, it is necessary  to conduct sprint or iteration planning meetings to discuss prioritized product backlog items (user stories) and decide  which of these items the team will commit to work on in the upcoming iteration. The team breaks down user stories to  low-level tasks, with estimates in hours, and then validates that the estimates are achievable based on team capacity  over the duration (iteration). This meeting is usually held on the ﬁrst day of the iteration and is attended by the product  owner, the Scrum team, and the project manager. The outcome of the meeting includes an iteration backlog, as well as  assumptions, concerns, risks, dependencies, decisions, and actions., Duration estimates are quantitative assessments of the likely number of time periods that are required to complete  an activity, a phase, or a project. Duration estimates do not include any lags as described in Section 6.3.2.3. Duration  estimates may include some indication of the range of possible results. For example: A range of 2 weeks ± 2 days, which indicates that the activity will take at least 8 days and not more than 12  (assuming a 5-day work week); or A 15% probability of exceeding 3 weeks, which indicates a high probability—85%—that the activity will take  3 weeks or less. , The amount and type of additional details supporting the duration estimate vary by application area. Regardless of  the level of detail, the supporting documentation should provide a clear and complete understanding of how the duration  estimate was derived. Supporting detail for duration estimates may include: Documentation of the basis of the estimate (i.e., how it was developed), Documentation of all assumptions made, Documentation of any known constraints, Indication of the range of possible estimates (e.g., ±10%) to indicate that the duration is estimated between a  range of values), Indication of the conﬁdence level of the ﬁnal estimate, and Documentation of individual project risks inﬂuencing this estimate., Project documents that may be updated as a result of carrying out this process include but are not limited to: Activity attributes. Described in Section 6.2.3.2. Activity duration estimates produced during this process are  documented as part of the activity attributes. Assumption log. Described in Section 4.1.3.2. This includes assumptions made in developing the duration  estimate, such as resource skill levels and availability, as well as a basis of estimates for durations. Additionally,  constraints arising out of the scheduling methodology and scheduling tool are also documented. Lessons learned register. Described in Section 4.4.3.1. The lessons learned register can be updated with  techniques that were efﬁcient and effective in developing effort and duration estimates.      , Develop Schedule is the process of analyzing activity sequences, durations, resource requirements, and schedule  constraints to create a schedule model for project execution and monitoring and controlling. The key beneﬁt of this  process is that it generates a schedule model with planned dates for completing project activities. This process  is performed throughout the project. The inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of this process are depicted in  Figure 6-14. Figure 6-15 depicts the data ﬂow diagram of the process.

Develop Schedule: Data Flow Diagram       Developing an acceptable project schedule is an iterative process. The schedule model is used to determine the  planned start and ﬁnish dates for project activities and milestones based on the best available information. Schedule  development can require the review and revision of duration estimates, resource estimates, and schedule reserves to  establish an approved project schedule that can serve as a baseline to track progress. Key steps include deﬁning the  project milestones, identifying and sequencing activities, and estimating durations. Once the activity start and ﬁnish  dates have been determined, it is common to have the project staff assigned to the activities review their assigned  activities. The staff conﬁrms that the start and ﬁnish dates present no conﬂict with resource calendars or assigned  activities on other projects or tasks and thus are still valid. The schedule is then analyzed to determine conﬂicts with  logical relationships and if resource leveling is required before the schedule is approved and baselined. Revising and  maintaining the project schedule model to sustain a realistic schedule continues throughout the duration of the project,  as described in Section 6.7. For more speciﬁc information regarding scheduling, refer to the Practice Standard for Scheduling., Described in Section 4.2.3.1. Project management plan components include but are not limited to: Schedule management plan. Described in Section 6.1.3.1. The schedule management plan identiﬁes the  scheduling method and tool used to create the schedule and how the schedule is to be calculated. Scope baseline. Described in Section 5.4.3.1. The scope statement, WBS, and WBS dictionary have details about  the project deliverables that are considered when building the schedule model., Project documents that can be considered as inputs for this process include but are not limited to: Activity attributes. Described in Section 6.2.3.2. The activity attributes provide the details used to build the   schedule model.  Activity list. Described in Section 6.2.3.1. The activity list identiﬁes the activities that will be included in the  schedule model. Assumption log. Described in Section 4.1.3.2. Assumptions and constraints recorded in the assumption log may  give rise to individual project risks that may impact the project schedule.  Basis of estimates. Described in Section 6.4.3.2. The amount and type of additional details supporting the  duration estimate vary by application area. Regardless of the level of detail, the supporting documentation should  provide a clear and complete understanding of how the duration estimate was derived. Duration estimates. Described in Section 6.4.3.1. The duration estimates contain the quantitative assessments  of the likely number of work periods that will be required to complete an activity. This will be used to calculate  the schedule. Lessons learned. Described in Section 4.4.3.1. Lessons learned earlier in the project with regard to developing  the schedule model can be applied to later phases in the project to improve the validity of the schedule model. Milestone list. Described in Section 6.2.3.3. The milestone list has scheduled dates for speciﬁc milestones. Project schedule network diagrams. Described in Section 6.3.3.1. The project schedule network diagrams  contain the logical relationships of predecessors and successors that will be used to calculate the schedule. Project team assignments. Described in Section 9.3.3.1. The project team assignments specify which resources  are assigned to each activity. Resource calendars. Described in Sections 9.2.1.2. The resource calendars contain information on the  availability of resources during the project. Resource requirements. Described in Section 9.2.3.1. The activity resource requirements identify the types and  quantities of resources required for each activity used to create the schedule model. Risk register. Described in Section 11.2.3.1. The risk register provides the details of all identiﬁed risks, and their  characteristics, that affect the schedule model. Risk information relevant to the schedule is reﬂected in schedule  reserves using the expected or mean risk impact., Described in Section 12.2.3.2. Vendors may have an input to the project schedule as they develop the details of how  they will perform the project work to meet contractual commitments.      , The enterprise environmental factors that can inﬂuence the Develop Schedule process include but are not limited to: Government or industry standards, and Communication channels., The organizational process assets that can inﬂuence the Develop Schedule process include but are not limited to: Scheduling methodology containing the policies governing schedule model development and maintenance,  and Project calendar(s)., Schedule network analysis is the overarching technique used to generate the project schedule model. It employs  several other techniques such as critical path method (described in Section 6.5.2.2), resource optimization techniques  (described in Section 6.5.2.3), and modeling techniques (described in Section 6.5.2.4). Additional analysis includes but  is not limited to: Assessing the need to aggregate schedule reserves to reduce the probability of a schedule slip when multiple  paths converge at a single point in time or when multiple paths diverge from a single point in time, to reduce the  probability of a schedule slip. Reviewing the network to see if the critical path has high-risk activities or long lead items that would necessitate  use of schedule reserves or the implementation of risk responses to reduce the risk on the critical path. Schedule network analysis is an iterative process that is employed until a viable schedule model is developed. , The critical path method is used to estimate the minimum project duration and determine the amount of schedule  ﬂexibility on the logical network paths within the schedule model. This schedule network analysis technique calculates  the early start, early ﬁnish, late start, and late ﬁnish dates for all activities without regard for any resource limitations  by performing a forward and backward pass analysis through the schedule network, as shown in Figure 6-16. In this  example, the longest path includes activities A, C, and D, and therefore the sequence of A-C-D is the critical path.  The critical path is the sequence of activities that represents the longest path through a project, which determines  the shortest possible project duration. The longest path has the least total ﬂoat—usually zero. The resulting early  and late start and ﬁnish dates are not necessarily the project schedule; rather they indicate the time periods within  which the activity could be executed, using the parameters entered in the schedule model for activity durations, logical  relationships, leads, lags, and other known constraints. The critical path method is used to calculate the critical path(s)  and the amount of total and free ﬂoat or schedule ﬂexibility on the logical network paths within the schedule model. On any network path, the total ﬂoat or schedule ﬂexibility is measured by the amount of time that a schedule  activity can be delayed or extended from its early start date without delaying the project ﬁnish date or violating a  schedule constraint. A critical path is normally characterized by zero total ﬂoat on the critical path. As implemented  with the precedence diagramming method sequencing, critical paths may have positive, zero, or negative total ﬂoat  depending on the constraints applied. Positive total ﬂoat is caused when the backward pass is calculated from a  schedule constraint that is later than the early ﬁnish date that has been calculated during forward pass calculation.  Negative total ﬂoat is caused when a constraint on the late dates is violated by duration and logic. Negative ﬂoat  analysis is a technique that helps to ﬁnd possible accelerated ways of bringing a delayed schedule back on track.  Schedule networks may have multiple near-critical paths. Many software packages allow the user to deﬁne the  parameters used to determine the critical path(s). Adjustments to activity durations (when more resources or less  scope can be arranged), logical relationships (when the relationships were discretionary to begin with), leads and  lags, or other schedule constraints may be necessary to produce network paths with a zero or positive total ﬂoat.  Once the total ﬂoat and the free ﬂoat have been calculated, the free ﬂoat is the amount of time that a schedule  activity can be delayed without delaying the early start date of any successor or violating a schedule constraint. For  example the free ﬂoat for Activity B, in Figure 6-16, is 5 days.         6 5 10, Resource optimization is used to adjust the start and ﬁnish dates of activities to adjust planned resource use to be  equal to or less than resource availability. Examples of resource optimization techniques that can be used to adjust the  schedule model due to demand and supply of resources include but are not limited to: Resource leveling. A technique in which start and ﬁnish dates are adjusted based on resource constraints with  the goal of balancing the demand for resources with the available supply. Resource leveling can be used when  shared or critically required resources are available only at certain times or in limited quantities, or are over-  allocated, such as when a resource has been assigned to two or more activities during the same time period (as  shown in Figure 6-17), or there is a need to keep resource usage at a constant level. Resource leveling can often   cause the original critical path to change. Available ﬂoat is used for leveling resources. Consequently, the critical  path through the project schedule may change. Resource smoothing. A technique that adjusts the activities of a schedule model such that the requirements for  resources on the project do not exceed certain predeﬁned resource limits. In resource smoothing, as opposed to  resource leveling, the project’s critical path is not changed and the completion date may not be delayed. In other  words, activities may only be delayed within their free and total ﬂoat. Resource smoothing may not be able to  optimize all resources.

Resource Leveling      , Data analysis techniques that can be used for this process include but are not limited to: What-if scenario analysis. What-if scenario analysis is the process of evaluating scenarios in order to predict  their effect, positive or negative, on project objectives. This is an analysis of the question, “What if the situation  represented by scenario X happens?” A schedule network analysis is performed using the schedule to compute  the different scenarios, such as delaying a major component delivery, extending speciﬁc engineering durations,  or introducing external factors, such as a strike or a change in the permit process. The outcome of the what-if  scenario analysis can be used to assess the feasibility of the project schedule under different conditions, and in  preparing schedule reserves and response plans to address the impact of unexpected situations. Simulation. Simulation models the combined effects of individual project risks and other sources of uncertainty  to evaluate their potential impact on achieving project objectives. The most common simulation technique is  Monte Carlo analysis (see Section 11.4.2.5), in which risks and other sources of uncertainty are used to calculate  possible schedule outcomes for the total project. Simulation involves calculating multiple work package durations  with different sets of activity assumptions, constraints, risks, issues, or scenarios using probability distributions  and other representations of uncertainty (see Section 11.4.2.4). Figure 6-18 shows a probability distribution for a  project with the probability of achieving a certain target date (i.e., project ﬁnish date). In this example, there is a  10% probability that the project will ﬁnish on or before the target date of May 13, while there is a 90% probability  of completing the project by May 28.  Project Finish Date 05/13/2017   20:30 05/28/17   19:45 10.0% 80.0% 10.0% 0.08 100.0% 0.07 87.5% 0.06 75.0% 0.05 62.5% 0.04 50.0% 0.03 37.5% 0.02 25.0% 0.01 12.5% 0.00 0.0% 05/05/2017   05/10/2017 05/15/2017 05/20/2017 05/25/2017 05/30/2017 06/04/2017 06/09/2017 06/14/2017 Figure 6-18. Example Probability Distribution of a Target Milestone For more information on how Monte Carlo simulation is used for schedule models, see the Practice Standard  for Scheduling., Described in Section 6.3.2.3. Leads and lags are reﬁnements applied during network analysis to develop a viable  schedule by adjusting the start time of the successor activities. Leads are used in limited circumstances to advance a  successor activity with respect to the predecessor activity, and lags are used in limited circumstances where processes  require a set period of time to elapse between the predecessors and successors without work or resource impact.      , Schedule compression techniques are used to shorten or accelerate the schedule duration without reducing the  project scope in order to meet schedule constraints, imposed dates, or other schedule objectives. A helpful technique  is the negative ﬂoat analysis. The critical path is the one with the least ﬂoat. Due to violating a constraint or imposed  date, the total ﬂoat can become negative. Schedule compression techniques are compared in Figure 6-19 and include: Crashing. A technique used to shorten the schedule duration for the least incremental cost by adding resources.  Examples of crashing include approving overtime, bringing in additional resources, or paying to expedite delivery  to activities on the critical path. Crashing works only for activities on the critical path where additional resources  will shorten the activity’s duration. Crashing does not always produce a viable alternative and may result in  increased risk and/or cost. Fast tracking. A schedule compression technique in which activities or phases normally done in sequence  are performed in parallel for at least a portion of their duration. An example is constructing the foundation for a  building before completing all of the architectural drawings. Fast tracking may result in rework and increased  risk. Fast tracking only works when activities can be overlapped to shorten the project duration on the critical  path. Using leads in case of schedule acceleration usually increases coordination efforts between the activities  concerned and increases quality risk. Fast tracking may also increase project costs.

Schedule Compression Comparison , Described in Section 4.3.2.2. Project management information systems include scheduling software that expedites  the process of building a schedule model by generating start and ﬁnish dates based on the inputs of activities, network  diagrams, resources, and activity durations., Agile release planning provides a high-level summary timeline of the release schedule (typically 3 to 6 months)  based on the product roadmap and the product vision for the product’s evolution. Agile release planning also  determines the number of iterations or sprints in the release, and allows the product owner and team to decide  how much needs to be developed and how long it will take to have a releasable product based on business goals,  dependencies, and impediments. Since features represent value to the customer, the timeline provides a more easily understood project schedule  as it deﬁnes which feature will be available at the end of each iteration, which is exactly the depth of information the  customer is looking for. Figure 6-20 shows the relationship among product vision, product roadmap, release planning, and iteration planning. Product vision drives product roadmap Release 1 Release 2 Release 3 Product roadmap drives release plans Release Plan Release plan establishes  Iteration 0 Iteration 1 Iteration 2 Iteration 3 Iteration n the iterations Iteration Plan Iteration plans schedules feature development Feature A Feature A Feature B Feature C Feature D (User Story 1) (User Story 2) (User Story 3) (User Story 4) (User Story 5) Prioritized features delivered by user stories (estimated Task A 5 Hours in story points) Task B 8 Hours Tasks (estimated in hours) created to Task C 4 Hours deliver user stories Task D 12 Hours Figure 6-20. Relationship Between Product Vision, Release Planning, and Iteration Planning      , A schedule baseline is the approved version of a schedule model that can be changed only through formal change  control procedures and is used as a basis for comparison to actual results. It is accepted and approved by the appropriate  stakeholders as the schedule baseline with baseline start dates and baseline ﬁnish dates. During monitoring and  controlling, the approved baseline dates are compared to the actual start and ﬁnish dates to determine if variances have  occurred. The schedule baseline is a component of the project management plan., The project schedule is an output of a schedule model that presents linked activities with planned dates, durations,  milestones, and resources. At a minimum, the project schedule includes a planned start date and planned ﬁnish date  for each activity. If resource planning is done at an early stage, the project schedule remains preliminary until resource  assignments have been conﬁrmed and scheduled start and ﬁnish dates are established. This process usually occurs no  later than the completion of the project management plan (Section 4.2.3.1). A target project schedule model may also  be developed with a deﬁned target start and target ﬁnish for each activity. The project schedule may be presented in  summary form, sometimes referred to as the master schedule or milestone schedule, or presented in detail. Although  a project schedule model can be presented in tabular form, it is more often presented graphically, using one or more of  the following formats: Bar charts. Also known as Gantt charts, bar charts represent schedule information where activities are listed  on the vertical axis, dates are shown on the horizontal axis, and activity durations are shown as horizontal  bars placed according to start and ﬁnish dates. Bar charts are relatively easy to read and are commonly used.  Depending on the audience, ﬂoat can be depicted or not. For control and management communications, the  broader, more comprehensive summary activity is used between milestones or across multiple interdependent  work packages and is displayed in bar chart reports. An example is the summary schedule portion of Figure 6-21  that is presented in a WBS-structured format.    Milestone charts. These charts are similar to bar charts, but only identify the scheduled start or completion of  major deliverables and key external interfaces. An example is the milestone schedule portion of Figure 6-21. Project schedule network diagrams. These diagrams are commonly presented in the activity-on-node  diagram format showing activities and relationships without a time scale, sometimes referred to as a pure  logic diagram, as shown in Figure 6-11, or presented in a time-scaled schedule network diagram format that  is sometimes called a logic bar chart, as shown for the detailed schedule in Figure 6-21. These diagrams, with  activity date information, usually show both the project network logic and the project’s critical path schedule  activities. This example also shows how each work package is planned as a series of related activities.  Another presentation of the project schedule network diagram is a time-scaled logic diagram. These diagrams  include a time scale and bars that represent the duration of activities with the logical relationships. They are  optimized to show the relationships between activities where any number of activities may appear on the  same line of the diagram in sequence.  Figure 6-21 shows schedule presentations for a sample project being executed, with the work in progress reported  through as-of date or status date. For a simple project schedule model, Figure 6-21 reﬂects schedule presentations in  the forms of (1) a milestone schedule as a milestone chart, (2) a summary schedule as a bar chart, and (3) a detailed  schedule as a project schedule linked bar chart diagram. Figure 6-21 also visually shows the relationships among the  different levels of detail of the project schedule.

The schedule data includes, at a minimum, the schedule milestones, schedule activities, activity attributes,  and documentation of all identiﬁed assumptions and constraints. The amount of additional data varies by application  area. Information frequently supplied as supporting detail includes but is not limited to: Resource requirements by time period, often in the form of a resource histogram; Alternative schedules, such as best-case or worst-case, not resource-leveled or resource-leveled, or with or  without imposed dates; and Applied schedule reserves. Schedule data could also include such items as resource histograms, cash-ﬂow projections, order and delivery  schedules, or other relevant information., A project calendar identiﬁes working days and shifts that are available for scheduled activities. It distinguishes  time periods in days or parts of days that are available to complete scheduled activities from time periods that are not  available for work. A schedule model may require more than one project calendar to allow for different work periods for  some activities to calculate the project schedule. The project calendars may be updated., Described in Section 4.3.3.4. Modiﬁcations to the project scope or project schedule may result in change requests  to the scope baseline, and/or other components of the project management plan. Change requests are processed for  review and disposition through the Perform Integrated Change Control process (Section 4.6). Preventive actions may  include recommended changes to eliminate or reduce the probability of negative schedule variances.      , Any change to the project management plan goes through the organization’s change control process via a change  request. Components that may require a change request for the project management plan include but are not limited to: Schedule management plan. Described in Section 6.1.3.1. The schedule management plan may be updated to  reﬂect a change in the way the schedule was developed and will be managed. Cost baseline. Described in Section 7.3.3.1. Changes to the cost baseline are incorporated in response to  approved changes in scope, resources, or cost estimates. In some cases, cost variances can be so severe that a  revised cost baseline is needed to provide a realistic basis for performance measurement., Project documents that may be updated as a result of carrying out this process include but are not limited to: Activity attributes. Described in Section 6.2.3.2. Activity attributes are updated to include any revised resource  requirements and any other revisions generated by the Develop Schedule process. Assumption log. Described in Section 4.1.3.2. The assumption log may be updated with changes to assumptions  in duration, resource utilization, sequencing, or other information that is revealed as a result of developing the  schedule model. Duration estimates. Described in Section 6.4.3.1. The number and availability of resources, along with the  activity dependencies can result in a change to the duration estimates. If the resource-leveling analysis changes  the resource requirements, then the duration estimates will likely need to be updated as well. Lessons learned register. Described in Section 4.4.3.1. The lessons learned register can be updated with  techniques that were efﬁcient and effective in developing the schedule model. Resource requirements. Described in Section 9.2.3.1. Resource leveling can have a signiﬁcant effect on  preliminary estimates for the types and quantities of resources required. If the resource-leveling analysis changes  the resource requirements, then the resource requirements are updated. Risk register. Described in Section 11.2.3.1. The risk register may need to be updated to reﬂect opportunities or   threats perceived through scheduling assumptions.  , Control Schedule is the process of monitoring the status of the project to update the project schedule and managing  changes to the schedule baseline. The key beneﬁt of this process is that the schedule baseline is maintained throughout  the project. This process is performed throughout the project. The inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of this  process are depicted in Figure 6-22. Figure 6-23 depicts the data ﬂow diagram of the process.

Control Schedule: Data Flow Diagram Updating the schedule model requires knowing the actual performance to date. Any change to the schedule baseline   can only be approved through the Perform Integrated Change Control process (Section 4.6). Control Schedule, as a   component of the Perform Integrated Change Control process, is concerned with: Determining the current status of the project schedule, Inﬂuencing the factors that create schedule changes, Reconsidering necessary schedule reserves, Determining if the project schedule has changed, and Managing the actual changes as they occur.  When an agile approach is used, Control Schedule is concerned with: Determining the current status of the project schedule by comparing the total amount of work delivered and  accepted against the estimates of work completed for the elapsed time cycle; Conducting retrospectives (scheduled reviews to record lessons learned) for correcting processes and improving,  if required; Reprioritizing the remaining work plan (backlog); Determining the rate at which the deliverables are produced, validated, and accepted (velocity) in the given time  per iteration (agreed-upon work cycle duration, typically 2 weeks or 1 month); Determining that the project schedule has changed; and Managing the actual changes as they occur. When work is being contracted, regular and milestone status updates from contractors and suppliers are a means of  ensuring the work is progressing as agreed upon to ensure the schedule is under control. Scheduled status reviews and  walkthroughs should be done to ensure the contractor reports are accurate and complete., Described in Section 4.2.3.1. Project management plan components include but are not limited to: Schedule management plan. Described in Section 6.1.3.1. The schedule management describes the frequency  that the schedule will be updated, how reserve will be used, and how the schedule will be controlled. Schedule baseline. Described in Section 6.5.3.1. The schedule baseline is compared with actual results to  determine if a change, corrective action, or preventive action is necessary. Scope baseline. Described in Section 5.4.3.1. The project WBS, deliverables, constraints, and assumptions  documented in the scope baseline are considered explicitly when monitoring and controlling the schedule  baseline. Performance measurement baseline. Described in Section 4.2.3.1. When using earned value analysis the  performance measurement baseline is compared to actual results to determine if a change, corrective action, or  preventive action is necessary.      , Project documents that can be considered as inputs for this process include but are not limited to: Lessons learned register. Described in Section 4.4.3.1. Lessons learned earlier in the project can be applied to  later phases in the project to improve schedule control. Project calendars. Described in Section 6.5.3.4. A schedule model may require more than one project calendar  to allow for different work periods for some activities to calculate the schedule forecasts. Project schedule. Described in Section 6.5.3.2. Project schedule refers to the most recent version with notations  to indicate updates, completed activities, and started activities as of the indicated date. Resource calendars. Described in Section 9.2.1.2. Resource calendars show the availability of team and  physical resources. Schedule data. Described in Section 6.5.3.3. Schedule data will be reviewed and updated in the Control  Schedule process., Described in Section 4.3.3.2. Work performance data contains data on project status such as which activities have  started, their progress (e.g., actual duration, remaining duration, and physical percent complete), and which activities  have ﬁnished., The organizational process assets that can inﬂuence the Control Schedule process include but are not limited to: Existing formal and informal schedule control-related policies, procedures, and guidelines; Schedule control tools; and Monitoring and reporting methods to be used.   , Data analysis techniques that can be used for this process include but are not limited to: Earned value analysis. Described in Section 7.4.2.2. Schedule performance measurements such as schedule  variance (SV) and schedule performance index (SPI) are used to assess the magnitude of variation to the original  schedule baseline. Iteration burndown chart. This chart tracks the work that remains to be completed in the iteration backlog. It  is used to analyze the variance with respect to an ideal burndown based on the work committed from iteration  planning (see Section 6.4.2.8). A forecast trend line can be used to predict the likely variance at iteration  completion and take appropriate actions during the course of the iteration. A diagonal line representing the ideal  burndown and daily actual remaining work is then plotted. A trend line is then calculated to forecast completion  based on remaining work. Figure 6-24 is an example of an iteration burndown chart. Iteration Burndown Chart Actual Remaining ork 200 Work, Described in Section 6.5.2.2. Comparing the progress along the critical path can help determine schedule status. The  variance on the critical path will have a direct impact on the project end date. Evaluating the progress of activities on  near critical paths can identify schedule risk., Described in Section 4.3.2.2. Project management information systems include scheduling software that provides  the ability to track planned dates versus actual dates, to report variances to and progress made against the schedule  baseline, and to forecast the effects of changes to the project schedule model., Described in Section 6.5.2.3. Resource optimization techniques involve the scheduling of activities and the resources  required by those activities while taking into consideration both the resource availability and the project time. , Adjusting leads and lags is applied during network analysis to ﬁnd ways to bring project activities that are behind into  alignment with the plan. For example, on a project to construct a new ofﬁce building, the landscaping can be adjusted to  start before the exterior work of the building is completed by increasing the lead time in the relationship, or a technical  writing team can adjust the start of editing the draft of a large document immediately after the document is written by  eliminating or decreasing lag time., Schedule compression techniques (see Section 6.5.2.6) are used to ﬁnd ways to bring project activities that are  behind into alignment with the plan by fast tracking or crashing the schedule for the remaining work., Described  in  Section  4.5.1.3. Work  performance  information  includes  information  on  how  the  project  work  is performing compared to the schedule baseline. Variances in the start and ﬁnish dates and the durations can be  calculated at the work package level and control account level. For projects using earned value analysis, the (SV) and  (SPI) are documented for inclusion in work performance reports (see Section 4.5.3.1)., Schedule updates are forecasts of estimates or predictions of conditions and events in the project’s future based on  information and knowledge available at the time of the forecast. Forecasts are updated and reissued based on work  performance information provided as the project is executed. The information is based on the project’s past performance  and expected future performance based on corrective or preventive actions. This can include earned value performance  indicators, as well as schedule reserve information that could impact the project in the future.      , Described in Section 4.3.3.4. Schedule variance analysis, as well as reviews of progress reports, results of performance  measures, and modiﬁcations to the project scope or project schedule, may result in change requests to the schedule  baseline, scope baseline, and/or other components of the project management plan. Change requests are processed  for review and disposition through the Perform Integrated Change Control process (Section 4.6). Preventive actions may  include recommended changes to eliminate or reduce the probability of negative schedule variances., Any change to the project management plan goes through the organization’s change control process via a change  request. Components that may require a change request for the project management plan include but are not limited to: Schedule management plan. Described in Section 6.1.3.1. The schedule management plan may be updated to  reﬂect a change in the way the schedule is managed. Schedule baseline. Described in Section 6.5.3.1. Changes to the schedule baseline are incorporated in  response to approved change requests related to change in project scope, resources, or activity duration  estimates. The schedule baseline may be updated to reﬂect changes caused by schedule compression  techniques or performance issues. Cost baseline. Described in Section 7.3.3.1. Changes to the cost baseline are incorporated in response to  approved changes in scope, resources, or cost estimates. Performance measurement baseline. Described in Section 4.2.3.1. Changes to the performance measurement  baseline are incorporated in response to approved changes in scope, schedule performance, or cost estimates.  In some cases, the performance variances can be so severe that a change request is put forth to revise the  performance measurement baseline to provide a realistic basis for performance measurement. , Project documents that may be updated as a result of carrying out this process include but are not limited to: Assumption log. Described in Section 4.1.3.2. Schedule performance may indicate the need to revise  assumptions on activity sequencing, durations, and productivity. Basis of estimates. Described in Section 6.4.3.2. Schedule performance may indicate the need to revise the  way duration estimates were developed. Lessons learned register. Described in Section 4.4.3.1. The lessons learned register can be updated with  techniques that were effective in maintaining the schedule, causes of variances, and corrective actions that were  used to respond to schedule variances. Project schedule. An updated project schedule (see Section 6.5.3.2) will be generated from the schedule model  populated with updated schedule data to reﬂect the schedule changes and manage the project. Resource calendars. Described in Section 9.2.1.2. Resource calendars are updated to reﬂect changes to  the utilization of resource calendars that were the result of optimizing resources, schedule compression, and  corrective or preventive actions. Risk register. Described in Section 11.2.3.1. The risk register and risk response plans within it, may be updated  based on the risks that may arise due to schedule compression techniques. Schedule data. Described in Section 6.5.3.3. New project schedule network diagrams may be developed to  display approved remaining durations and approved modiﬁcations to the schedule. In some cases, project  schedule delays can be so severe that a new target schedule with forecasted start and ﬁnish dates is needed to  provide realistic data for directing the work, measuring performance, and measuring progress.      , Project Cost Management includes the processes involved in planning, estimating, budgeting, ﬁnancing, funding,  managing, and controlling costs so that the project can be completed within the approved budget. The Project Cost  Management processes are: 7.1 Plan Cost Management—The process of deﬁning how the project costs will be estimated, budgeted, managed,  monitored, and controlled. 7.2 Estimate Costs—The process of developing an approximation of the monetary resources needed to complete  project work. 7.3 Determine Budget—The process of aggregating the estimated costs of individual activities or work packages to  establish an authorized cost baseline. 7.4 Control Costs—The process of monitoring the status of the project to update the project costs and manage  changes to the cost baseline. Figure 7-1 provides an overview of the Project Cost Management processes. The Project Cost Management processes  are presented as discrete processes with deﬁned interfaces, while in practice they overlap and interact in ways that  cannot be completely detailed in the PMBOK® . These processes interact with each other and with processes in  other Knowledge Areas. On some projects, especially those of smaller scope, cost estimating and cost budgeting are tightly linked and can  be viewed as a single process that can be performed by a single person over a relatively short period of time. They are  presented here as distinct processes because the tools and techniques for each are different. The ability to inﬂuence   cost is greatest at the early stages of the project, making early scope deﬁnition critical (see Section 5.3).

Project Cost Management Overview      , Plan Cost Management is the process of deﬁning how the project costs will be estimated, budgeted, managed,  monitored, and controlled. The key beneﬁt of this process is that it provides guidance and direction on how the project  costs will be managed throughout the project. This process is performed once or at predeﬁned points in the project. The  inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of this process are depicted in Figure 7-2. Figure 7-3 depicts the data ﬂow  diagram of the process.

Plan Cost Management: Data Flow Diagram  The cost management planning effort occurs early in project planning and sets the framework for each of the cost  management processes so that performance of the processes will be efﬁcient and coordinated. The cost management  processes and their associated tools and techniques are documented in the cost management plan. The cost management  plan is a component of the project management plan., Described in Section 4.2.3.1. The project charter provides the preapproved ﬁnancial resources from which the detailed  project costs are developed. The project charter also deﬁnes the project approval requirements that will inﬂuence the  management of the project costs., Described in Section 4.2.3.1. Project management plan components include but are not limited to: Schedule management plan. Described in Section 6.1.3.1. The schedule management plan establishes the  criteria and the activities for developing, monitoring, and controlling the schedule. The schedule management  plan provides processes and controls that will impact cost estimation and management. Risk management plan. Described in Section 11.1.3.1. The risk management plan provides the approach for  identifying, analyzing, and monitoring risks. The risk management plan provides processes and controls that will  impact cost estimation and management., The enterprise environmental factors that can inﬂuence the Plan Cost Management process include but are not  limited to: Organizational culture and structure can inﬂuence cost management. Market conditions describe what products, services, and results are available in the regional and global markets. Currency exchange rates for project costs are sourced from more than one country.       Published commercial information such as resource cost rate information is often available from commercial  databases that track skills and human resource costs, and provide standard costs for material and equipment.  Published seller price lists are another source of information. Project management information system provides alternative possibilities for managing cost. Productivity differences in different parts of the world can have a large inﬂuence on the cost of projects., The organizational process assets that can inﬂuence the Plan Cost Management process include but are not limited to: Financial controls procedures (e.g., time reporting, required expenditure and disbursement reviews, accounting  codes, and standard contract provisions); Historical information and lessons learned repository; Financial databases; and Existing formal and informal cost estimating and budgeting-related policies, procedures, and guidelines., Described in Section 4.1.2.1 Expertise should be considered from individuals or groups with specialized knowledge  or training in the following topics: Previous similar projects; Information in the industry, discipline, and application area; Cost estimating and budgeting; and Earned value management.     , A data analysis technique that can be used for this process includes but is not limited to alternatives analysis.  Alternatives analysis can include reviewing strategic funding options such as: self-funding, funding with equity, or  funding with debt. It can also include consideration of ways to acquire project resources such as making, purchasing,  renting, or leasing., Project teams may hold planning meetings to develop the cost management plan. Attendees may include the project  manager, the project sponsor, selected project team members, selected stakeholders, anyone with responsibility for  project costs, and others as needed., The cost management plan is a component of the project management plan and describes how the project costs will  be planned, structured, and controlled. The cost management processes and their associated tools and techniques are  documented in the cost management plan. For example, the cost management plan can establish the following: Units of measure. Each unit used in measurements (such as staff hours, staff days, or weeks for time measures;  meters, liters, tons, kilometers, or cubic yards for quantity measures; or lump sum in currency form) is deﬁned  for each of the resources. Level of precision. This is the degree to which cost estimates will be rounded up or down (e.g., US$995.59 to  US$1,000), based on the scope of the activities and magnitude of the project. Level of accuracy. The acceptable range (e.g., ±10%) used in determining realistic cost estimates is speciﬁed,  and may include an amount for contingencies.       Organizational procedures links. The work breakdown structure (WBS) (Section 5.4) provides the  framework for the cost management plan, allowing for consistency with the estimates, budgets, and control  of costs. The WBS component used for the project cost accounting is called the control account. Each  control account is assigned a unique code or account number(s) that links directly to the performing  organization’s accounting system. Control thresholds. Variance thresholds for monitoring cost performance may be speciﬁed to indicate an  agreed-upon amount of variation to be allowed before some action needs to be taken. Thresholds are typically  expressed as percentage deviations from the baseline plan. Rules of performance measurement. Earned value management (EVM) rules of performance measurement are  set. For example, the cost management plan may: nuDeﬁne the points in the WBS at which measurement of control accounts will be performed; nuEstablish the EVM techniques (e.g., weighted milestones, ﬁxed-formula, percent complete, etc.) to be  employed; and nuSpecify tracking methodologies and the EVM computation equations for calculating projected estimate at  completion (EAC) forecasts to provide a validity check on the bottom-up EAC. Reporting formats. The formats and frequency for the various cost reports are deﬁned. Additional details. Additional details about cost management activities include but are not limited to: nuDescription of strategic funding choices, nuProcedure to account for ﬂuctuations in currency exchange rates, and nuProcedure for project cost recording. For more speciﬁc information regarding earned value management, refer to the Practice Standard for Earned Value  Management – Second Edition [17]. , Estimate Costs is the process of developing an approximation of the cost of resources needed to complete project  work. The key beneﬁt of this process is that it determines the monetary resources required for the project. This process  is performed periodically throughout the project as needed. The inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of this process  are depicted in Figure 7-4. Figure 7-5 depicts the data ﬂow diagram of the process.

Estimate Costs: Data Flow Diagram       A cost estimate is a quantitative assessment of the likely costs for resources required to complete the activity. It is a  prediction that is based on the information known at a given point in time. Cost estimates include the identiﬁcation and  consideration of costing alternatives to initiate and complete the project. Cost trade-offs and risks should be considered,  such as make versus buy, buy versus lease, and the sharing of resources in order to achieve optimal costs for the project. Cost estimates are generally expressed in units of some currency (i.e., dollars, euros, yen, etc.), although in some  instances other units of measure, such as staff hours or staff days, are used to facilitate comparisons by eliminating the  effects of currency ﬂuctuations. Cost estimates should be reviewed and reﬁned during the course of the project to reﬂect additional detail as it becomes  available and assumptions are tested. The accuracy of a project estimate will increase as the project progresses through  the project life cycle. For example, a project in the initiation phase may have a rough order of magnitude (ROM) estimate  in the range of −25% to +75%. Later in the project, as more information is known, deﬁnitive estimates could narrow  the range of accuracy to −5% to +10%. In some organizations, there are guidelines for when such reﬁnements can be  made and the degree of conﬁdence or accuracy that is expected. Costs are estimated for all resources that will be charged to the project. This includes but is not limited to labor,  materials, equipment, services, and facilities, as well as special categories such as an inﬂation allowance, cost of  ﬁnancing, or contingency costs. Cost estimates may be presented at the activity level or in summary form., Described in Section 4.2.3.1. Project management plan components include but are not limited to: Cost management plan. Described in Section 7.1.3.1. The cost management plan describes estimating methods  that can be used and the level of precision and accuracy required for the cost estimate. Quality management plan. Described in Section 8.1.3.1. The quality management plan describes the activities  and resources necessary for the project management team to achieve the quality objectives set for the project.    Scope baseline. Described in Section 5.4.3.1. The scope baseline includes the project scope statement, WBS,  and WBS dictionary: nuProject scope statement. The scope statement (Section 5.3.3.1) reﬂects funding constraints by period for the  expenditure of project funds or other ﬁnancial assumptions and constraints. nuWork breakdown structure. The WBS (Section 5.4.3.1) provides the relationships among all the project  deliverables and their various components. nuWBS dictionary. The WBS dictionary (Section 5.4.3.) and related detailed statements of work provide an  identiﬁcation of the deliverables and a description of the work in each WBS component required to produce  each deliverable., Project documents that can be considered as inputs for this process include but are not limited to: Lessons learned register. Described in Section 4.4.3.1. Lessons learned earlier in the project with regard to  developing cost estimates can be applied to later phases in the project to improve the accuracy and precision of  the cost estimates. Project schedule. Described in Section 6.5.3.2. The schedule includes the type, quantity, and amount of time  that team and physical resources will be active on the project. The duration estimates (Section 6.4.3.1) will  affect cost estimates when resources are charged per unit of time and when there are seasonal ﬂuctuations  in costs. The schedule also provides useful information for projects that incorporate the cost of ﬁnancing  (including interest charges). Resource requirements. Described in Section 9.2.3.1. Resource requirements identify the types and quantities  of resources required for each work package or activity. Risk register. Described in Section 11.2.3.1. The risk register contains details of individual project risks that  have been identiﬁed and prioritized, and for which risk responses are required. The risk register provides detailed  information that can be used to estimate costs.      , The enterprise environmental factors that can inﬂuence the Estimate Costs process include but are not limited to: Market conditions. These conditions describe what products, services, and results are available in the market,  from whom, and under what terms and conditions. Regional and/or global supply and demand conditions greatly  inﬂuence resource costs. Published commercial information. Resource cost rate information is often available from commercial  databases that track skills and human resource costs, and provide standard costs for material and equipment.  Published seller price lists are another source of information. Exchange rates and inflation. For large-scale projects that extend multiple years with multiple currencies, the  ﬂuctuations of currencies and inﬂation need to be understood and built into the Estimate Cost process., The organizational process assets that can inﬂuence the Estimate Costs process include but are not limited to: Cost estimating policies, Cost estimating templates, Historical information and lessons learned repository., Described in Section 4.1.2.1 Expertise should be considered from individuals or groups with specialized knowledge  or training in the following topics: Previous similar projects; Information in the industry, discipline, and application area; and Cost estimating methods. , Described in Section 6.4.2.2. Analogous cost estimating uses values, or attributes, of a previous project that are  similar to the current project. Values and attributes of the projects may include but are not limited to: scope, cost, budget,  duration, and measures of scale (e.g., size, weight). Comparison of these project values, or attributes, becomes the basis  for estimating the same parameter or measurement for the current project. , Described in Section 6.4.2.3. Parametric estimating uses a statistical relationship between relevant historical data  and other variables (e.g., square footage in construction) to calculate a cost estimate for project work. This technique can  produce higher levels of accuracy depending on the sophistication and underlying data built into the model. Parametric  cost estimates can be applied to a total project or to segments of a project, in conjunction with other estimating methods., Described in Section 6.4.2.5. Bottom-up estimating is a method of estimating a component of work. The cost  of individual work packages or activities is estimated to the greatest level of specified detail. The detailed cost  is then summarized or “rolled up” to higher levels for subsequent reporting and tracking purposes. The cost and  accuracy of bottom-up cost estimating are typically influenced by the size or other attributes of the individual  activity or work package., Described in Section 6.4.2.4. The accuracy of single-point cost estimates may be improved by considering estimation  uncertainty and risk and using three estimates to deﬁne an approximate range for an activity’s cost: Most likely (cM). The cost of the activity, based on realistic effort assessment for the required work and any  predicted expenses. Optimistic (cO). The cost based on analysis of the best-case scenario for the activity. Pessimistic (cP). The cost based on analysis of the worst-case scenario for the activity.       Depending on the assumed distribution of values within the range of the three estimates, the expected cost, cE, can  be calculated using a formula. Two commonly used formulas are triangular and beta distributions. The formulas are: Triangular distribution. cE = (cO + cM + cP) / 3 Beta distribution. cE = (cO + 4cM + cP) / 6 Cost estimates based on three points with an assumed distribution provide an expected cost and clarify the range of  uncertainty around the expected cost., Data analysis techniques that can be used in the Estimate Costs process include but are not limited to: Alternatives analysis. Alternatives analysis is a technique used to evaluate identiﬁed options in order to select  which options or approaches to use to execute and perform the work of the project. An example would be  evaluating the cost, schedule, resource, and quality impacts of buying versus making a deliverable. Reserve analysis. Cost estimates may include contingency reserves (sometimes called contingency allowances)  to account for cost uncertainty. Contingency reserves are the budget within the cost baseline that is allocated for  identiﬁed risks. Contingency reserves are often viewed as the part of the budget intended to address the known- unknowns that can affect a project. For example, rework for some project deliverables could be anticipated, while  the amount of this rework is unknown. Contingency reserves may be estimated to account for this unknown  amount of rework. Contingency reserves can be provided at any level from the speciﬁc activity to the entire  project. The contingency reserve may be a percentage of the estimated cost, a ﬁxed number, or may be developed  by using quantitative analysis methods. As more precise information about the project becomes available, the contingency reserve may be used, reduced,  or eliminated. Contingency should be clearly identiﬁed in cost documentation. Contingency reserves are part of  the cost baseline and the overall funding requirements for the project. Cost of quality. Assumptions about costs of quality (Section 8.1.2.3) may be used to prepare the estimates. This  includes evaluating the cost impact of additional investment in conformance versus the cost of nonconformance.  It can also include looking at short-term cost reductions versus the implication of more frequent problems later  on in the product life cycle. , Described in Section 4.3.2.2. The project management information system can include spreadsheets, simulation  software, and statistical analysis tools to assist with cost estimating. Such tools simplify the use of some cost-estimating  techniques and thereby facilitate rapid consideration of cost estimate alternatives., The decision-making techniques that can be used in the Estimate Costs process include but are not limited to voting.  Described in Section 5.2.2.4, voting is an assessment process having multiple alternatives with an expected outcome in  the form of future actions. These techniques are useful for engaging team members to improve estimate accuracy and  commitment to the emerging estimates., Cost estimates include quantitative assessments of the probable costs required to complete project work, as well as  contingency amounts to account for identiﬁed risks, and management reserve to cover unplanned work. Cost estimates  can be presented in summary form or in detail. Costs are estimated for all resources that are applied to the cost  estimate. This includes but is not limited to direct labor, materials, equipment, services, facilities, information technology,  and special categories such as cost of ﬁnancing (including interest charges), an inﬂation allowance, exchange rates,  or a cost contingency reserve. Indirect costs, if they are included in the project estimate, can be included at the activity  level or at higher levels.      , The amount and type of additional details supporting the cost estimate vary by application area. Regardless of  the level of detail, the supporting documentation should provide a clear and complete understanding of how the cost  estimate was derived. Supporting detail for cost estimates may include: Documentation of the basis of the estimate (i.e., how it was developed), Documentation of all assumptions made, Documentation of any known constraints, Documentation of identiﬁed risks included when estimating costs, Indication of the range of possible estimates (e.g., US$10,000 (±10%) to indicate that the item is expected to  cost between a range of values), and Indication of the conﬁdence level of the ﬁnal estimate., Project documents that may be updated as a result of carrying out this process include but are not limited to: Assumption log. Described in Section 4.1.3.2. During the Cost Estimates process, new assumptions may be  made, new constraints may be identiﬁed, and existing assumptions or constraints may be revisited and changed.  The assumption log should be updated with this new information. Lessons learned register. Described in Section 4.4.3.1. The lessons learned register can be updated with  techniques that were efﬁcient and effective in developing cost estimates. Risk register. Described in Section 11.2.3.1. The risk register may be updated when appropriate risk responses  are chosen and agreed upon during the Estimate Cost process.   , Determine Budget is the process of aggregating the estimated costs of individual activities or work packages to  establish an authorized cost baseline. The key beneﬁt of this process is that it determines the cost baseline against  which project performance can be monitored and controlled. This process is performed once or at predeﬁned points in  the project. The inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of this process are depicted in Figure 7-6. Figure 7-7 depicts  the data ﬂow diagram of the process. A project budget includes all the funds authorized to execute the project. The cost baseline is the approved version of  the time-phased project budget that includes contingency reserves, but excludes management reserves.

The cost management plan describes how the project  costs will be structured into the project budget. Resource management plan. Described in Section 9.1.3.1. The resource management plan provides information  on rates (personnel and other resources), estimation of travel costs, and other foreseen costs that are necessary  to estimate the overall project budget.

The scope baseline includes the project scope statement, WBS,  and WBS dictionary details for cost estimation and management., Examples of project documents that can be considered as inputs for this process include but are not limited to: Basis of estimates. Described in Section 6.4.3.2. Supporting detail for cost estimates contained in the basis for  estimates should specify any basic assumptions dealing with the inclusion or exclusion of indirect or other costs  in the project budget. Cost estimates. Described in Section 7.2.3.1. Cost estimates for each activity within a work package are  aggregated to obtain a cost estimate for each work package. Project schedule. Described in Section 6.5.3.2. The project schedule includes planned start and ﬁnish dates  for the project’s activities, milestones, work packages, and control accounts. This information can be used to  aggregate costs to the calendar periods in which the costs are planned to be incurred. Risk register. Described in Section 11.2.3.1. The risk register should be reviewed to consider how to aggregate  the risk response costs. Updates to the risk register are included with project documents updates described in  Section 11.5.3.3.      , Described in Section 1.2.6. The business documents that can be considered as inputs for this process include but  are not limited to: Business case. The business case identiﬁes the critical success factors for the project, including ﬁnancial  success factors. Benefits management plan. The beneﬁts management plan includes the target beneﬁts, such as net present  value calculations, timeframe for realizing beneﬁts, and the metrics associated with the beneﬁts., Described in Section 12.2.3.2. Applicable agreement information and costs relating to products, services, or results  that have been or will be purchased are included when determining the budget., The enterprise environmental factors that can inﬂuence the Estimate Costs process include but are not limited  to exchange rates. For large-scale projects that extend multiple years with multiple currencies, the ﬂuctuations of  currencies need to be understood and built into the Determine Budget process., The organizational process assets that can inﬂuence the Determine Budget process include but are not limited to: Existing formal and informal cost budgeting-related policies, procedures, and guidelines; Historical information and lessons learned repository. Cost budgeting tools; and Reporting methods.   , Described in Section 4.1.2.1. Expertise should be considered from individuals or groups with specialized knowledge  or training in the following topics: Previous similar projects; Information in the industry, discipline, and application area; Financial principles; and Funding requirement and sources., Cost estimates are aggregated by work packages in accordance with the WBS. The work package cost estimates  are then aggregated for the higher component levels of the WBS (such as control accounts) and, ultimately, for the  entire project., A data analysis technique that can be used in the Determine Budget process includes but is not limited to reserve  analysis, which can establish the management reserves for the project. Management reserves are an amount of  the project budget withheld for management control purposes and are reserved for unforeseen work that is within  scope of the project. Management reserves are intended to address the unknown unknowns that can affect a project.  The management reserve is not included in the cost baseline but is part of the overall project budget and funding  requirements. When an amount of management reserves is used to fund unforeseen work, the amount of management  reserve used is added to the cost baseline, thus requiring an approved change to the cost baseline.      , Reviewing historical information can assist in developing parametric estimates or analogous estimates. Historical  information may include project characteristics (parameters) to develop mathematical models to predict total project  costs. Such models may be simple (e.g., residential home construction is based on a certain cost per square foot of space)  or complex (e.g., one model of software development costing uses multiple separate adjustment factors, each of which  has numerous points within it). Both the cost and accuracy of analogous and parametric models can vary widely. They are most likely to be  reliable when: Historical information used to develop the model is accurate, Parameters used in the model are readily quantiﬁable, and Models are scalable, such that they work for large projects, small projects, and phases of a project., The expenditure of funds should be reconciled with any funding limits on the commitment of funds for the project.  A variance between the funding limits and the planned expenditures will sometimes necessitate the rescheduling of  work to level out the rate of expenditures. This is accomplished by placing imposed date constraints for work into  the project schedule., Financing entails acquiring funding for projects. It is common for long-term infrastructure, industrial, and public  services projects to seek external sources of funds. If a project is funded externally, the funding entity may have certain  requirements that are required to be met. , The cost baseline is the approved version of the time-phased project budget, excluding any management reserves,  which can only be changed through formal change control procedures. It is used as a basis for comparison to actual  results. The cost baseline is developed as a summation of the approved budgets for the different schedule activities. Figure 7-8 illustrates the various components of the project budget and cost baseline. Cost estimates for the various  project activities, along with any contingency reserves (see Section 7.2.2.6) for these activities, are aggregated  into their associated work package costs. The work package cost estimates, along with any contingency reserves  estimated for the work packages, are aggregated into control accounts. The summation of the control accounts  make up the cost baseline. Since the cost estimates that make up the cost baseline are directly tied to the schedule  activities, this enables a time-phased view of the cost baseline, which is typically displayed in the form of an S-curve,  as is illustrated in Figure 7-9. For projects that use earned value management, the cost baseline is referred to as the  performance measurement baseline. Management reserves (Section 7.2.2.3) are added to the cost baseline to produce the project budget. As changes  warranting the use of management reserves arise, the change control process is used to obtain approval to move the  applicable management reserve funds into the cost baseline.         Project Management Budget Reserve Contingency Cost Control Reserve Baseline Accounts Work Package Activity Cost Estimates Contingency Reserve Activity Cost Estimates nt u o m, Total funding requirements and periodic funding requirements (e.g., quarterly, annually) are derived from the cost  baseline. The cost baseline will include projected expenditures plus anticipated liabilities. Funding often occurs in  incremental amounts, and may not be evenly distributed, which appear as steps in Figure 7-9. The total funds required  are those included in the cost baseline plus management reserves, if any. Funding requirements may include the  source(s) of the funding., Project documents that may be updated as a result of carrying out this process include but are not limited to: Cost estimates. Described in Section 7.2.3.1. Cost estimates are updated to record any additional information. Project schedule. Described in Section 6.5.3.2. Estimated costs for each activity may be recorded as part of the  project schedule. Risk register. Described in Section 11.2.3.1. New risks identiﬁed during this process are recorded in the risk  register and managed using the risk management processes.      , Control Costs is the process of monitoring the status of the project to update the project costs and managing changes  to the cost baseline. The key beneﬁt of this process is that the cost baseline is maintained throughout the project. This  process is performed throughout the project. The inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of this process are depicted  in Figure 7-10. Figure 7-11 depicts the data ﬂow diagram of the process.

Control Costs: Data Flow Diagram       Updating the budget requires knowledge of the actual costs spent to date. Any increase to the authorized budget can  only be approved through the Perform Integrated Change Control process (Section 4.6). Monitoring the expenditure of  funds without regard to the value of work being accomplished for such expenditures has little value to the project, other  than to track the outﬂow of funds. Much of the effort of cost control involves analyzing the relationship between the  consumption of project funds and the work being accomplished for such expenditures. The key to effective cost control  is the management of the approved cost baseline. Project cost control includes: Inﬂuencing the factors that create changes to the authorized cost baseline; Ensuring that all change requests are acted on in a timely manner; Managing the actual changes when and as they occur; Ensuring that cost expenditures do not exceed the authorized funding by period, by WBS component, by activity,  and in total for the project; Monitoring cost performance to isolate and understand variances from the approved cost baseline; Monitoring work performance against funds expended; Preventing unapproved changes from being included in the reported cost or resource usage; Informing appropriate stakeholders of all approved changes and associated cost; and Bringing expected cost overruns within acceptable limits., Described in Section 4.2.3.1. Project management plan components include but are not limited to: Cost management plan. Described in Section 7.1.3.1. The cost management plan describes how the project   costs will be managed and controlled.  Cost baseline. Described in Section 7.3.3.1. The cost baseline is compared with actual results to determine if a  change, corrective action, or preventive action is necessary. Performance measurement baseline. Described in Section 4.2.3.1. When using earned value analysis, the  performance measurement baseline is compared to actual results to determine if a change, corrective action, or  preventive action is necessary. , Examples of project documents that can be considered as inputs for this process include but are not limited to the  lessons learned register. Described in Section 4.4.3.1. Lessons learned earlier in the project can be applied to later  phases in the project to improve cost control., Described in Section 7.3.3.2. The project funding requirements include projected expenditures plus anticipated liabilities., Described in Section 4.3.3.2. Work performance data contains data on project status such as which costs have been  authorized, incurred, invoiced, and paid., The organizational process assets that can inﬂuence the Control Costs process include but are not limited to: Existing formal and informal cost control-related policies, procedures, and guidelines; Cost control tools; and Monitoring and reporting methods to be used., Described in Section 4.1.2.1. Examples of expert judgment during the Control Costs process include but are not  limited to: Variance analysis, Earned value analysis, Forecasting, and Financial analysis.      , Data analysis techniques that can be used to control costs include but are not limited to: Earned value analysis (EVA). Earned value analysis compares the performance measurement baseline to the  actual schedule and cost performance. EVM integrates the scope baseline with the cost baseline and schedule  baseline to form the performance measurement baseline. EVM develops and monitors three key dimensions for  each work package and control account: nuPlanned value. Planned value (PV) is the authorized budget assigned to scheduled work. It is the authorized  budget planned for the work to be accomplished for an activity or work breakdown structure (WBS) component,  not including management reserve. This budget is allocated by phase over the life of the project, but at a given  point in time, planned value deﬁnes the physical work that should have been accomplished. The total of the  PV is sometimes referred to as the performance measurement baseline (PMB). The total planned value for the  project is also known as budget at completion (BAC). nuEarned value. Earned value (EV) is a measure of work performed expressed in terms of the budget authorized  for that work. It is the budget associated with the authorized work that has been completed. The EV being  measured needs to be related to the PMB, and the EV measured cannot be greater than the authorized  PV budget for a component. The EV is often used to calculate the percent complete of a project. Progress  measurement criteria should be established for each WBS component to measure work in progress. Project  managers monitor EV, both incrementally to determine current status and cumulatively to determine the long- term performance trends. nuActual cost. Actual cost (AC) is the realized cost incurred for the work performed on an activity during a  speciﬁc time period. It is the total cost incurred in accomplishing the work that the EV measured. The AC  needs to correspond in deﬁnition to what was budgeted in the PV and measured in the EV (e.g., direct hours  only, direct costs only, or all costs including indirect costs). The AC will have no upper limit; whatever is spent  to achieve the EV will be measured.  Variance analysis. Described in Section 4.5.2.2. Variance analysis, as used in EVM, is the explanation (cause,  impact, and corrective actions) for cost (CV = EV – AC), schedule (SV = EV – PV), and variance at completion  (VAC = BAC – EAC) variances. Cost and schedule variances are the most frequently analyzed measurements.  For projects not using formal earned value analysis, similar variance analyses can be performed by comparing  planned cost against actual cost to identify variances between the cost baseline and actual project performance.  Further analysis can be performed to determine the cause and degree of variance relative to the schedule  baseline and any corrective or preventive actions needed. Cost performance measurements are used to assess  the magnitude of variation to the original cost baseline. An important aspect of project cost control includes  determining the cause and degree of variance relative to the cost baseline (see Section 7.3.3.1) and deciding  whether corrective or preventive action is required. The percentage range of acceptable variances will tend to  decrease as more work is accomplished. Examples of variance analysis include but are not limited to: nuSchedule variance. Schedule variance (SV) is a measure of schedule performance expressed as the difference  between the earned value and the planned value. It is the amount by which the project is ahead or behind  the planned delivery date, at a given point in time. It is a measure of schedule performance on a project. It  is equal to the earned value (EV) minus the planned value (PV). The EVA schedule variance is a useful metric  in that it can indicate when a project is falling behind or is ahead of its baseline schedule. The EVA schedule  variance will ultimately equal zero when the project is completed because all of the planned values will have  been earned. Schedule variance is best used in conjunction with critical path method (CPM) scheduling and  risk management. Equation: SV = EV – PV. nuCost variance. Cost variance (CV) is the amount of budget deﬁcit or surplus at a given point in time, expressed  as the difference between earned value and the actual cost. It is a measure of cost performance on a project.  It is equal to the earned value (EV) minus the actual cost (AC). The cost variance at the end of the project will  be the difference between the budget at completion (BAC) and the actual amount spent. The CV is particularly  critical because it indicates the relationship of physical performance to the costs spent. Negative CV is often  difﬁcult for the project to recover. Equation: CV = EV – AC.       nuSchedule performance index. The schedule performance index (SPI) is a measure of schedule efﬁciency  expressed as the ratio of earned value to planned value. It measures how efﬁciently the project team is  accomplishing the work. It is sometimes used in conjunction with the cost performance index (CPI) to forecast  the ﬁnal project completion estimates. An SPI value less than 1.0 indicates less work was completed than  was planned. An SPI greater than 1.0 indicates that more work was completed than was planned. Since the  SPI measures all project work, the performance on the critical path also needs to be analyzed to determine  whether the project will ﬁnish ahead of or behind its planned ﬁnish date. The SPI is equal to the ratio of the  EV to the PV. Equation: SPI = EV/PV. nuCost performance index. The cost performance index (CPI) is a measure of the cost efﬁciency of budgeted  resources, expressed as a ratio of earned value to actual cost. It is considered the most critical EVA metric  and measures the cost efﬁciency for the work completed. A CPI value of less than 1.0 indicates a cost overrun  for work completed. A CPI value greater than 1.0 indicates a cost underrun of performance to date. The CPI is  equal to the ratio of the EV to the AC. Equation: CPI = EV/AC. Trend analysis. Described in Section 4.5.2.2. Trend analysis examines project performance over time to determine  if performance is improving or deteriorating. Graphical analysis techniques are valuable for understanding  performance to date and for comparison to future performance goals in the form of BAC versus estimate at  completion (EAC) and completion dates. Examples of the trend analysis techniques include but are not limited to: nuCharts. In earned value analysis, three parameters of planned value, earned value, and actual cost can be  monitored and reported on both a period-by-period basis (typically weekly or monthly) and on a cumulative  basis. Figure 7-12 uses S-curves to display EV data for a project that is performing over budget and behind  the schedule.  Project Budget, The to-complete performance index (TCPI) is a measure of the cost performance that is required to be achieved with  the remaining resources in order to meet a speciﬁed management goal, expressed as the ratio of the cost to ﬁnish  the outstanding work to the remaining budget. TCPI is the calculated cost performance index that is achieved on the  remaining work to meet a speciﬁed management goal, such as the BAC or the EAC. If it becomes obvious that the BAC  is no longer viable, the project manager should consider the forecasted EAC. Once approved, the EAC may replace the  BAC in the TCPI calculation. The equation for the TCPI based on the BAC: (BAC – EV) / (BAC – AC). The TCPI is conceptually displayed in Figure 7-13. The equation for the TCPI is shown in the lower left as the work  remaining (deﬁned as the BAC minus the EV) divided by the funds remaining (which can be either the BAC minus the  AC, or the EAC minus the AC). If the cumulative CPI falls below the baseline (as shown in Figure 7-13), all future work of the project will need  to be performed immediately in the range of the TCPI (BAC) (as reﬂected in the top line of Figure 7-13) to stay  within the authorized BAC. Whether this level of performance is achievable is a judgment call based on a number of  considerations, including risk, time remaining in the project, and technical performance. This level of performance  is displayed as the TCPI (EAC) line. The equation for the TCPI is based on the EAC: (BAC – EV) / (EAC – AC). The EVM  formulas are provided in Table 7-1.         Table 7-1.

Project management information systems are often used to monitor the three EVM  dimensions (PV, EV, and AC), to display graphical trends, and to forecast a range of possible ﬁnal project results., Described in Section 4.5.1.3. Work performance information includes information on how the project work is  performing compared to the cost baseline. Variances in the work performed and the cost of the work are evaluated at  the work package level and control account level. For projects using earned value analysis, CV, CPI, EAC, VAC, and TCPI  are documented for inclusion in work performance reports (Section 4.5.3.1).      , Either a calculated EAC value or a bottom-up EAC value is documented and communicated to stakeholders., Described in Section 4.3.3.4. Analysis of project performance may result in a change request to the cost and  schedule baselines or other components of the project management plan. Change requests are processed for review  and disposition through the Perform Integrated Change Control process (Section 4.6)., Any change to the project management plan goes through the organization’s change control process via a change  request. Components that may require a change request for the project management plan include but are not limited to: Cost management plan. Described in Section 7.1.3.1. Changes to the cost management plan, such as changes  to control thresholds or speciﬁed levels of accuracy required in managing the project’s cost, are incorporated in  response to feedback from relevant stakeholders. Cost baseline. Described in Section 7.3.3.1. Changes to the cost baseline are incorporated in response to  approved changes in scope, resources, or cost estimates. In some cases, cost variances can be so severe that a  revised cost baseline is needed to provide a realistic basis for performance measurement. Performance measurement baseline. Described in Section 4.2.3.1. Changes to the performance measurement  baseline are incorporated in response to approved changes in scope, schedule performance, or cost estimates.  In some cases, the performance variances can be so severe that a change request is put forth to revise the  performance measurement baseline to provide a realistic basis for performance measurement.   , Project documents that may be updated as a result of carrying out this process include but are not limited to: Assumption log. Described in Section 4.1.3.2. Cost performance may indicate the need to revise assumptions  on resource productivity and other factors inﬂuencing cost performance. Basis of estimates. Described in Section 6.4.3.2. Cost performance may indicate the need to revisit the original  basis of estimates. Cost estimates. Described in Section 7.2.3.1. Cost estimates may need to be updated to reﬂect the actual cost  efﬁciency for the project. Lessons learned register. Described in Section 4.4.3.1. The lessons learned register can be updated with  techniques that were effective in maintaining the budget, variance analysis, earned value analysis, forecasting,  and corrective actions that were used to respond to cost variances. Risk register. Described in Section 11.2.3.1. The risk register may be updated if the cost variances have crossed,  or are likely to cross, the cost threshold.      '"
