# Knowledge-based-Recommendation-system-for-project-management (PMBOK 6th edition)

🎯This is an academic research project
💻This project uses ontology based NLP in order to help the readers find what they are looking for in a short ammount of time by simply introducing few key words.
During this project i have worked on the following :

Extracting data from pdf document, preprocessing and preparing Data pipelines using external libraries and unsupervised learning.
Extracting schemas and figures as Images using fine tuning techniques for yolo v5 model.
Creating and understanding the ontology base on prepared data.
Creating an end to end web application using custom deep learning architecture with services consisting in :
✅Conducting a hybrid conversation and responding with intelligent answers that fits the asked question.
✅Extracting the inputs, outputs and tools and techniques with detailed data like images and figures.
✅Deployment of the app on multiple platforms ( Web / desktop / mobile)
